<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Christina of Denmark is known to the world by
Holbein's famous portrait in the National Gallery.
The great Court painter, who was sent to Brussels
by Henry VIII. to take the likeness of the Emperor's
niece, did his work well. With unerring skill he has
rendered the "singular good countenance," the clear
brown eyes with their frank, honest gaze, the smile
hovering about "the faire red lips," the slender
fingers of the nervously clasped hands, which Brant&ocirc;me
and his royal mistress, Catherine de' Medici,
thought "the most beautiful hands in the world."
And in a wonderful way he has caught the subtle
charm of the young Duchess's personality, and made
it live on his canvas. What wonder that Henry fell
in love with the picture, and vowed that he would have
the Duchess, if she came to him without a farthing!
But for all these brave words the masterful King's
wooing failed. The ghost of his wronged wife,
Katherine of Aragon, the smoke of plundered abbeys,
and the blood of martyred friars, came between him
and his destined bride, and Christina was never
numbered in the roll of Henry VIII.'s wives. This
splendid, if perilous, adventure was denied her. But
many strange experiences marked the course of her
chequered life, and neither beauty nor virtue could
save her from the shafts of envious Fortune. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
troubles began from the cradle. When she was little
more than a year old, her father, King Christian II.,
was deposed by his subjects, and her mother, the
gentle Isabella of Austria, died in exile of a broken
heart. She lost her first husband, Francesco Sforza,
at the end of eighteen months. Her second husband,
Francis Duke of Lorraine, died in 1545, leaving her once
more a widow at the age of twenty-three. Her only son
was torn from her arms while still a boy by a foreign
invader, Henry II., and she herself was driven into
exile. Seven years later she was deprived of the
regency of the Netherlands, just when the coveted
prize seemed within her grasp, and the last days of
her existence were embittered by the greed and
injustice of her cousin, Philip II.</p>

<p>Yet, in spite of hard blows and cruel losses, Christina's
life was not all unhappy. The blue bird&mdash;the symbol
of perpetual happiness in the faery lore of her own
Lorraine&mdash;may have eluded her grasp, but she filled
a great position nobly, and tasted some of the deepest
and truest of human joys. Men and women of all
descriptions adored her, and she had a genius for
friendship which survived the charms of youth and
endured to her dying day. A woman of strong
affections and resolute will, she inherited a considerable
share of the aptitude for government that distinguished
the women of the Habsburg race. Her
relationship with Charles V. and residence at the
Court of Brussels brought her into close connection
with political events during the long struggle with
France, and it was in a great measure due to her
exertions that the peace which ended this Sixty Years'
War was finally concluded at C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis in
1559.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span></p>

<p>Holbein's Duchess, it is evident, was a striking
figure, and her life deserves more attention than it
has hitherto received. Brant&ocirc;me honoured her with
a place in his gallery of fair ladies, and the sketch
which he has drawn, although inaccurate in many
details, remains true in its main outlines. But with
this exception Christina's history has never yet been
written. The chief sources from which her biography
is drawn are the State Archives of Milan and Brussels,
supplemented by documents in the Record Office,
the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, the Biblioteca Zelada
near Pavia, and the extremely interesting collection
of Guise letters in the Balcarres Manuscripts, which has
been preserved in the Advocates' Library at Edinburgh.
A considerable amount of information, as
will be seen from the Bibliography at the end of this
volume, has been collected from contemporary
memoirs, from the histories of Bucholtz and Henne,
and the voluminous correspondence of Cardinal
Granvelle and Philip II., as well as from Tudor,
Spanish, and Venetian State Papers.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I have to acknowledge the kind
help which I have received in my researches from
Monsignor Rodolfo Maiocchi, Rector of the Borromeo
College at Pavia, from Signor O. F. Tencajoli, and
from the keepers of English and foreign archives,
among whom I must especially name Signor Achille
Giussani, of the Archivio di Stato at Milan, Monsieur
Gaillard, Director of the Brussels Archives, and Mr.
Hubert Hall. My sincere thanks are due to Count
Antonio Cavagna Sangiuliani for giving me permission
to make use of manuscripts in his library at Zelada;
to Monsieur Leon Cardon for leave to reproduce four
of the Habsburg portraits in his fine collection at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
Brussels; and to Mr. Henry Oppenheimer for allowing
me to publish his beautiful and unique medal of
the Duchess of Milan. I must also thank Sir Kenneth
Mackenzie and the Trustees of the Advocates' Library
for permission to print a selection from the Balcarres
Manuscripts, and Mr. Campbell Dodgson and Mr. G. F.
Hill for the kindness with which they have placed
the treasures of the British Museum at my disposal.
Lastly, a debt of gratitude, which I can never sufficiently
express, is due to Dr. Hagberg-Wright and the
staff of the London Library for the invaluable help
which they have given me in this, as in all my other
works.</p>

ISABELLA OF AUSTRIA, QUEEN OF DENMARK,
THE MOTHER OF CHRISTINA<br />

1507-1514</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The 19th of July, 1507, was a memorable day in the
history of Malines. A solemn requiem Mass was sung
that morning in the ancient church of S. Rombaut
for the soul of Philip, King of Castille and Archduke
of Austria, and, by right of his mother, Duke of
Burgundy and Count of Flanders and Brabant.
The news of this young monarch's sudden death at
Burgos had spread consternation throughout the
Netherlands, where the handsome, free-handed Prince
was very popular with the subjects who enjoyed peace
and prosperity under his rule. "Never," wrote a
contemporary chronicler, "was there such lamentation
made for any King, Duke, or Count, as for our
good King Philip. There was no church or monastery
in the whole land where solemn Masses were not said
for the repose of his soul, and the mourning was
greatest in the city of Antwerp, where all the people
assembled for the yearly Fair wept over this noble
young Prince who had died at the age of twenty-eight."<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
The King's corpse was laid in the dark
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>vaults of Miraflores, where his widow, the unhappy
Queen Juana, kept watch by her husband's grave
night and day; while, in obedience to his last wishes,
his heart was brought to the Netherlands and buried
in his mother's tomb at Bruges. Now the States-General
and nobles were summoned by Margaret of
Austria, the newly-proclaimed Governess of the
Netherlands, to attend her brother's funeral at
Malines.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">July, 1507</span>] MARGARET OF AUSTRIA</div>

<p>From the gates of the Keyserhof, through the
narrow streets of the old Flemish city, the long procession
wound its way: Knights of the Golden Fleece,
nobles, deputies, Bishops and clergy, merchants,
artisans, and beggars, all clad in deep mourning.
Twelve heralds, followed by a crowd of gentlemen
with lighted torches, bore the armour and banners of
the dead King to the portals of S. Rombaut. There
an immense catafalque, draped with cloth of gold
and blazing with wax lights, had been erected in the
centre of the nave. Three golden crowns, symbols of
the three realms over which Philip held sway, hung
from the vault, and the glittering array of gold and
silver images on the high-altar stood out against the
sable draperies on the walls. A funeral oration was
pronounced by the late King's confessor, the Bishop
of Arras chanted the requiem Mass, and when the
last blessing had been given, Golden Fleece threw his
staff on the floor, crying: "The King is dead!"<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> At
the sound of these thrice-repeated words the heralds
lowered their banners to the ground, and there was a
moment of profound silence, only broken by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>sound of weeping. Then Golden Fleece cried in a
ringing voice: "Charles, Archduke of Austria!" and
all eyes were turned to the fair, slender boy, who,
robed in a long black mantle, knelt alone before the
altar. "My lord lives! long may he live!" cried
the King-at-Arms; and a great shout went up on
all sides: "Long live Charles, Archduke of Austria
and Prince of Castille!" A sword blessed by the
Bishop of Arras was placed in the boy's hands,
and the heralds of Burgundy, Flanders, Holland, and
Friesland, raising their fallen pennons, each in turn
proclaimed the titles of the youthful Prince, who was
to be known to the world as Charles V.</p>

<p>No one wept more bitterly for King Philip than his
only sister, Margaret, the widowed Duchess of Savoy,
as she knelt in her oratory close to the great church.
Although only twenty-seven, she had known many
sorrows. After being wedded to the Dauphin at two
years old, and educated at the French Court till she
reached the age of thirteen, she was rejected by
Charles VIII. in favour of Anne of Brittany, and sent
back to her father, the Emperor Maximilian. Three
years afterwards she went to Spain as the bride of
Don Juan, the heir to the crowns of Castille and
Aragon, only to lose her husband and infant son
within a few months of each other. In 1501 she
became the wife of Duke Philibert of Savoy, with
whom she spent the three happiest years of her life.
But in September, 1504, the young Duke died of
pleurisy, the result of a chill which he caught out
hunting, and his heart-broken widow returned once
more to her father's Court.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1509</span>] MAXIMILIAN'S GRANDCHILDREN</div>

<p>On the death of Philip in the following year,
Maximilian prevailed upon his daughter to undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
the government of the Netherlands, and in April,
1507, Margaret was proclaimed Regent, and took up
her abode at Malines. She was a singularly able and
gifted woman, and her personal charms and rich
dowry soon attracted new suitors. Before she became
Regent she had received proposals of marriage from
Henry VII. of England, which Maximilian urged her
to accept, saying that she might divide the year
between England and the Netherlands. Louis XII.,
who in his boyhood had played with the Archduchess
at Amboise, would also gladly have made her his
second wife, but, as he remarked: "Madame Marguerite's
father has arranged marriages for her three
times over, and each time she has fared badly."
Margaret herself was quite decided on the subject, and
declared that she would never marry again. Henceforth
she devoted herself exclusively to the administration
of the Netherlands and the guardianship of
her brother's young family. Of the six children
which Juana of Castille had borne him, two remained
in Spain, the younger boy Ferdinand and the infant
Katherine, who did not see the light until months
after her father's death. But the elder boy, Charles,
and his three sisters, grew up under their aunt's eye
in the picturesque old palace at Malines, which is
still known as the Keyserhof, or Cour de l'Empereur.
The eldest girl, Eleanor, afterwards Queen of Portugal
and France, was two years older than her brother;
the second, Isabella, the future Queen of Denmark,
born on the 15th of August, 1501, was nearly six; and
Mary, the Queen of Hungary, who was to play so
great a part in the history of the Netherlands, had
only just completed her first year. Margaret, whose
own child hardly survived its birth, lavished all a
mother's affection on her youthful nephew and
nieces. If the boy was naturally the chief object of
her care, the little girls held a place very near to her
heart. This was especially the case with "Madame
Isabeau," her godchild, who was born when Margaret
was living at Malines before her second marriage. A
gentle and charming child, Isabella won the hearts
of all, and became fondly attached to the brother
who was so nearly her own age.</p>

<p>Margaret's letters to the Emperor abound in allusions
to these children, whose welfare was a matter of deep
interest to their grandfather. In the midst of the
most anxious affairs of State, when he was presiding
over turbulent Diets or warring beyond the Alps,
Maximilian was always eager for news of "our very
dear and well-beloved children." The arrangements
of their household, the choice of their tutors and
companions, their childish maladies and amusements,
were all fully reported to him. One unlucky day,
when the royal children had just recovered from
measles, Madame Isabeau caught the smallpox, and
gave it to Madame Marie. Then Madame Leonore
complained of her head, and since Margaret had been
told that the malady was very contagious, and especially
dangerous in winter, she felt it advisable to keep
her nephew at Brussels out of reach of infection. But
this precaution proved fruitless, for presently the boy
sickened and became dangerously ill. Great was the
alarm which his condition excited, and it was only
at the end of three weeks that Margaret was able to
inform the Emperor, who was in Italy fighting against
the Venetians, that his grandson was out of danger.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1509</span>] A SFORZA DUKE</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>The education of Charles and his sisters was the
subject of their guardian's most anxious consideration.
A lady of Navarre, Dame Anne de Beaumont, took
charge of the little girls from their infancy, and
watched over them with a tenderness which earned
their lifelong gratitude. The old King of Aragon
rewarded this lady with the Order of S. Iago, while
Margaret begged that she might be allowed to spend
her old age in one of the Archduke's houses at Ghent,
seeing that she had served "Mesdames mes ni&egrave;ces" so
long and so well, and had been but poorly paid for
her trouble. Among their teachers was Louis Vives,
the learned friend of Erasmus, who afterwards became
tutor to their cousin, the Princess Mary of
England, and took Sir Thomas More's daughters as
his models. Vives taught his pupils Greek and Latin,
and made them study the Gospels, and St. Paul's
Epistles, as well as some parts of the Old Testament.
French romances, then so much in vogue, were banished
from their schoolroom, and the only tales
which they were allowed to read were those of Joseph
and his brethren, of the Roman matron Lucretia,
and the well-known story of Griselda. Madame
Leonore was fond of reading at a very early age,
but Madame Isabeau was more occupied with her
dolls, and is represented holding one in her arms
in the triptych of Charles and his sisters at Vienna.
All the children were very fond of music, in which
they were daily instructed by the Archduchess's
organist, and there is a charming portrait of Eleanor
playing on the clavichord in Monsieur Cardon's collection
at Brussels. When, in 1508, the Spanish Legate,
Cardinal Carvajal, visited Malines, Charles and his
sisters were confirmed by him in the palace chapel,
and the Archduke addressed a letter of thanks to
Pope Julius II. in his childish round hand.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret was careful to provide her young charges
with suitable companions. A niece of Madame de
Beaumont and a Spanish girl of noble birth were
brought up with the Archduchesses, while the sons
of the Marquis of Brandenburg and Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg
were among Charles's playmates. Another
youth whom the Emperor sent to be educated at
Malines in 1509 was his godson, Maximilian Sforza,
the eldest son of the unfortunate Duke Lodovico and
Beatrice d'Este. While his younger brother, Francesco,
afterwards the husband of Christina of Denmark,
remained at Innsbruck with his cousin, the
Empress Bianca, Maximilian grew up with Charles,
and throughout his life never ceased to regard
Margaret as a second mother. The young Duke of
Milan's name often figures in the Archduchess's correspondence
with her father. One day Maximilian
tells her to borrow 3,000 livres from the Fuggers, and
give them to the Duke, who has not enough to buy
his own clothes, let alone those of his servants.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
At another time we find Margaret appealing to her
father to settle the disputes of precedence which
have arisen between the Dukes of Milan and Saxe-Lauenburg,
upon which Maximilian replied that they
were too young to think of such matters, and that
for the present they had better take the place of
honour on alternate days.</p>

<p>It was a free and joyous life which these young
Princes and Princesses led at the Court of Malines.
If they were kept strictly to their lessons, they also
had plenty of amusements. They played games,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
shot with bows and arrows, and looked on at stag-hunts
from the balcony of the Swan, an old hostelry
in the market-place. Charles had a little chariot,
drawn by two ponies, in which he often drove his
sisters through the town and out into the open
country. Above all they enjoyed the visits which
they paid to the Castle of Vueren, near Brussels,
where Charles often went by his grandfather's orders
to enjoy fresh air and take hunting expeditions.
The old Emperor was delighted to hear of his
grandson's taste for sport, and wrote from Augsburg
that, if the Archduke had not been fond of
hunting, people would have suspected him of being
a bastard.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1512</span>] "FELIX AUSTRIA NUBE"</div>

<p>When, in 1512, Maximilian came to Brussels, and
Charles was sent to meet him, he begged Margaret to
bring the three Princesses, without delay, to "amuse
themselves in the park at Vueren," and sent the
haunch of a stag which he had killed that day as a
present to his "dear little daughters." At the
children's urgent entreaty, the Emperor himself rode
out to join them at supper, and invited them to a
banquet in the palace at Brussels on Midsummer
Day. When the English Ambassador, Sir Edward
Poynings, came to pay the Emperor his respects, he
found His Majesty in riding-boots, standing at the
palace gates, with the Lady Regent, the Lord Prince
and his sisters, looking on at a great bonfire in the
square. The Ambassador and his colleague, Spinelli,
were both invited to return to the palace for supper,
and had a long conversation with the Lady Margaret,
in whom they found the same perfect friend as ever,
"while the Prince and his sisters danced gaily with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>the other young folk till between nine and ten
o'clock."<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>But this merry party was soon to break up. Before
the end of the year Maximilian Sforza crossed the
Brenner, and entered Milan amidst the acclamations
of his father's old subjects, and eighteen months later
two of the young Archduchesses were wedded to
foreign Kings.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1514</span>] MARRIAGE-MAKING</div>

<p>While her nieces were still children Margaret was
busy with plans for their marriage. Her views for
them were ambitious and frankly expressed. "All
your granddaughters," she wrote to her father,
"should marry Kings." The old Emperor himself
was an inveterate matchmaker, and the House of
Austria had been proverbially fortunate in its alliances.
<i>Tu felix Austria nube</i> had passed into a
common saying. By his marriage with Mary of Burgundy,
Maximilian entered on the vast inheritance of
Charles the Bold, and his grandson was heir to the
throne of Spain by right of his mother Juana. In
1509 proposals for two of the Archduchesses came
from Portugal, and Margaret urged her father to
accept these offers, remarking shrewdly that King
Emanuel was a wealthy monarch, and that there
were few marriageable Princes in Europe. If both
Madame Leonore and Madame Marie were betrothed
to the two Portuguese Princes, there would still
be two of her nieces to contract other alliances.
But Maximilian's thoughts were too much occupied
with his war against Venice to consider these proposals
seriously, and the matter was allowed to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>drop.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Meanwhile Madame Isabeau's hand was in great
request. In March, 1510, Maximilian received offers
of marriage for his second granddaughter from the
King of Navarre's son, Henri d'Albret, but this
project was nipped in the bud by the jealousy of
Isabella's other grandfather, Ferdinand of Aragon,
and Francis I.'s sister, Margaret, Duchess of Alen&ccedil;on,
became Queen of Navarre in her stead. A new and
strange husband for the nine-year-old Princess was
now proposed by the Regent herself. This was none
other than Charles of Egmont, Duke of Guelders, the
turbulent neighbour who had been a thorn in Margaret's
side ever since she became Governess of the
Netherlands. It is difficult to believe that Margaret
ever really intended to give her beloved niece to the
man whom she openly denounced as "a brigand and
a felon," but it was necessary to cajole Guelders for
the moment, and conferences were held in which
every detail of the marriage treaty was discussed,
and the dowry and fortune of the bride and the
portions of her sons and daughters were all minutely
arranged. But when the deputies of Guelders asked
that Madame Isabeau should be given up to the Duke
at once to be educated at his Court, the Regent met
their demands with a flat refusal. The negotiations
were broken off, and war began again.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Another
matrimonial project, which had been discussed ever
since King Philip's lifetime, was the union of the
Archduchess Eleanor with the young Duke Antoine
of Lorraine. Maximilian seems to have been really
eager for this marriage, which he regarded as a means
of detaching a neighbouring Prince from the French
alliance, but was so dilatory in the matter that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>Margaret wrote him a sharp letter, asking him if he
ever meant to marry his granddaughters. Upon this
the affronted Emperor rebuked her for these undutiful
remarks, and asked peevishly "if she held him for
a Frenchman who changed his mind every day."<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
But in spite of these protestations he took no further
steps in the matter, and in 1515 Duke Antoine
married Ren&eacute;e de Bourbon, a Princess of the blood
royal of France.</p>

<p>The marriage of Louis XII. to Henry VIII.'s handsome
sister Mary was a more serious blow. Six years
before the English Princess had been wedded by proxy
to the Archduke Charles, and Margaret, whose heart
was set on this alliance, vainly pressed her father to
conclude the treaty. Meanwhile, in January, 1514,
Anne of Brittany died, and the widowed King sent
offers of marriage, first to Margaret herself, and then
to her niece Eleanor.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> A few months later news
reached Brussels that Louis had made a treaty with
Henry, and was about to wed the Princess Mary.
So the Archduke lost his promised bride, and his
sister was once more cheated of a husband. The
Lady Regent was deeply hurt, but found some consolation
for her wounded feelings in the double
marriage that was arranged in the course of the same
year between the Archduke Ferdinand and Anna,
daughter of Ladislaus, King of Hungary, and between
this monarch's son Louis and the Archduchess Mary.
In May, 1514, the little Princess was sent to be
educated with her future sister-in-law at Vienna,
where the wedding was celebrated a year afterwards.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>At the same time marriage proposals for another of
his granddaughters reached Maximilian from a new
and unexpected quarter. The young King of Denmark,
Christian II., on succeeding to the throne,
declined the French marriage which had been arranged
for him by his father, and conceived the ambitious
design of allying himself with the Imperial Family.
In March, 1514, two Danish Ambassadors, the Bishop
of Schleswig and the Court-Marshal Magnus Gi&#339;,
were introduced into Maximilian's presence by
Christian's uncle, the Elector of Saxony, and asked
for the Archduchess Eleanor's hand on behalf of their
royal master. The prospect of an alliance with
Denmark met with the Emperor's approval, and
could not fail to be popular in the Low Countries as
a means of opening the Baltic to the merchants of
Bruges and Amsterdam. Accordingly the envoys
met with a friendly reception, and were told that,
although the elder Archduchess was already promised
to the Duke of Lorraine, the Emperor would gladly
give King Christian the hand of her sister Isabella.
The contract was signed at Linz on the 29th of April,
1514, and the dowry of the Princess was fixed at
250,000 florins, an enormous sum for those times.
Only three-fifths of his sister's fortune, however, was
to be paid by Charles, and the remainder by her
grandfather, the King of Aragon.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1514</span>] A ROYAL WEDDING</div>

<p>From Linz the Ambassadors travelled by slow
stages to Brussels, where they were received with
great honour. But Margaret was scarcely prepared
for the proposal which they made, that the wedding
might take place on the following day, when King
Christian was to be crowned at Copenhagen. It was,
however, impossible to refuse such a request, and on
Trinity Sunday, the 11th of June, the marriage was
solemnized with due splendour. At ten o'clock a
brilliant assembly met in the great hall of the palace,
which had been hung for the occasion with the famous
tapestries of the Golden Fleece, and Magnus Gi&#339;,
who represented the King, appeared, supported by
the Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg and the Marquis of
Brandenburg. Presently a flourish of trumpets announced
the bride's coming, and Charles led in his
sister, a tall, slender maiden of thirteen, robed in
white, with a crown of pearls and rubies on her fair
locks. "Madame Isabeau," as Margaret wrote with
motherly pride to her father, "was certainly good to
see."<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> They took their places under a baldacchino
near the altar, followed by the Regent, who led her
niece Eleanor by the hand. The Archbishop of
Cambray, clad in rich vestments of purple and gold,
performed the nuptial rites, and the Danish Ambassador
placed a costly ring, bearing three gold crowns
set round with large sapphires and the motto <i>Ave
Maria gratia plena</i>, on the finger of the bride, who
plighted her faith in the following words:</p>

<p>"Je, Isabelle d'Autriche et de Bourgogne, donne
ma foi &agrave; tr&egrave;s hautt et tr&egrave;s puissant Prince et Seigneur,
Christierne roy de Danemarck, et &agrave; toy Magnus Gi&#339;,
son vrai et l&eacute;al procureur, et je le prens par toy en
&eacute;poux et mari l&eacute;gitime."<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Then the Mass of the Holy Ghost was chanted, the
Spanish Ambassador being seated at the Archduke's
side, and the others according to their rank, all but
the English Envoy, who refused to be present owing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>to a dispute as to precedence. Afterwards the guests
were entertained by the Regent at a banquet, followed
by a tournament and a state ball, which was kept up
far into the night. Finally all the chief personages
present escorted the bride with lighted torches to her
chamber, and Magnus Gi&#339;, in full armour, lay down
on the nuptial bed at her side in the presence of this
august company. Then, rising to his feet, he made
a deep obeisance to the young Queen and retired.
During the next three days a succession of jousts and
banquets took place, and on the Feast of Corpus
Christi a public reception was held in the palace, at
which the bride appeared wearing the ring of the
three kingdoms and a jewelled necklace sent her by
King Christian. Unfortunately, the Archduke danced
so vigorously on the night of the wedding that this
unwonted exertion brought on a sharp attack of
fever.</p>

<p>"Monseigneur," wrote his aunt to the Emperor,
"fulfilled all his duties to perfection, and showed
himself so good a brother that he overtaxed his
strength, and fell ill the day after the wedding.
Not," she hastened to add, "that his sickness is in any
way serious, but that the slightest ailment in a
Prince of his condition is apt to make one anxious."<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1515</span>] EVIL OMENS</div>

<p>On the 4th of July the Danish Ambassadors took
their leave, but Isabella remained in her home for
another year. She and Eleanor shared in the f&ecirc;tes
which celebrated the Archduke's coming of age, and
were present at his <i>Joyeuse Entr&ecirc;e</i> into Brussels.
But in the midst of these festivities the Danish fleet,
with the Archbishop of Drondtheim on board, arrived
at Veeren in Zeeland, and on the 16th of July, 1515,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>the poor young Queen took leave of her family with
bitter tears, and sailed for Copenhagen. On the day
of Isabella's christening, fourteen years before, the
ceremony had been marred by a terrific thunderstorm,
and now the same ill-luck attended her wedding
journey. A violent tempest scattered the Danish
fleet off the shores of Jutland, and the vessel which
bore the Queen narrowly escaped shipwreck. When
at length she had landed safely at Helsingfors, she
wrote a touching little letter to the Regent:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Madame, my Aunt and good Mother</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"I must tell you that we landed here last
Saturday, after having been in great peril and distress
at sea for the last ten days. But God kept me from
harm, for which I am very thankful. Next Thursday
we start for Copenhagen, which is a day's journey
from here. I have been rather ill, and feel weak still,
but hope soon to be well. Madame, if I could choose
for myself I should be with you now; for to be parted
from you is the most grievous thing in the world to
me, and the more so as I do not know when there is
any hope of seeing you again. So I can only beg you,
my dearest aunt and mother, to keep me in your
heart, and tell me if there is anything that you wish
me to do, and you shall always be obeyed, God helping
me. That He may give you a long and happy life is
the prayer of your humble and dutiful niece</p>

</p>
</div>

<p>Two days later Isabella continued her journey to
Hvidore, the royal country-house near Copenhagen.
There she was received by King Christian, who rode
at her side, a splendid figure in gold brocade and
shining armour, when on the following day she made
her state entry into the capital in torrents of rain.
On the 12th of August the wedding was celebrated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>in the great hall of the ancient castle, which had been
rebuilt by King Christian's father, and was followed
by the coronation of the young Queen. But Isabella
was so much exhausted by the fatigue which she had
undergone, that before the conclusion of the ceremony
she fell fainting into the arms of her ladies. Her
illness threw a gloom over the wedding festivities,
and seemed a forecast of the misfortunes that were
to darken the course of her married life and turn her
story into a grim tragedy.</p>

<h2>BOOK II<br />

CHRISTIAN II., KING OF DENMARK, THE
FATHER OF CHRISTINA<br />

1513-1523</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Christian II., King of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,
as the proud title ran, was in many respects a
remarkable man. His life and character have been
the subject of much controversy. Some historians
have held him up to admiration as a patriot and
martyr who suffered for his love of freedom and
justice. Others have condemned him as a cruel and
vindictive tyrant, whose crimes deserved the hard
fate which befell him. Both verdicts are justified
in the main. On the one hand, he was an able and
enlightened ruler, who protected the liberties of his
poorer subjects, encouraged trade and learning, and
introduced many salutary reforms. On the other,
he was a man of violent passions, crafty and unscrupulous
in his dealings, cruel and bloodthirsty in
avenging wrongs. His career naturally invites comparison
with that of Lodovico Sforza, whose son
became the husband of his daughter Christina. Both
Princes were men of great ability and splendid
dreams. In their zeal for the promotion of commerce
and agriculture, in their love of art and letters, both
were in advance of the age in which they lived.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Again, their vices and crimes, the cunning ways and
unscrupulous measures by which they sought to
attain their ends, were curiously the same. No
doubt Christian II., born and bred as he was among
the rude Norsemen, belonged to a coarser strain than
the cultured Duke of Milan, and is hardly to be judged
by the same standard. But the two Princes resembled
each other closely, and the fate which eventually
overtook them was practically the same. Both of
these able and distinguished men lost their States in
the prime of life, and were doomed to end their days
in captivity. This cruel doom has atoned in a great
measure for their guilt in the eyes of posterity, and
even in their lifetime their hard fate aroused general
compassion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1516</span>] THE KING'S DOVE</div>

<p>Certainly no one could have foreseen the dismal
fate which lay in store for Christian II. when he
ascended the throne. Seldom has a new reign opened
with fairer promise. His father, good King Hans,
died in 1513, lamented by all his subjects, and leaving
his successor a prosperous and united kingdom.
Christian was thirty-two, and had already shown his
courage and ability in quelling a revolt in Norway.
A man of noble and commanding presence, with blue
eyes and long fair hair, he seemed a born leader of
men, while his keen intelligence, genial manners, and
human interest in those about him, early won the affection
of his subjects. Unfortunately his own passions
proved his worst enemies. In Norway he had fallen
in love with a beautiful girl named Dyveke&mdash;the Dove&mdash;whose
mother, a designing Dutchwoman named
Sigebritt Willems, kept a tavern at Bergen. On his
accession he brought Dyveke and her mother to
Hvidore, and gave them a house in the neighbour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>hood.
This illicit connection excited great scandal
at Court, and the Chancellor, Archbishop Walkendorf
of Drondtheim, exhorted the King earnestly to put
away his mistress on his marriage. Even before
Isabella left Brussels, the Archbishop wrote glowing
accounts of her beauty and goodness to his master,
and told the King of the romantic attachment which
she cherished for her unknown lord. After her arrival
at Copenhagen he did his utmost to insure her comfort,
and see that she was treated with proper respect.</p>

<p>For a time Christian seems to have been genuinely
in love with his young wife, whose innocent charm
won all hearts in her new home. In his anxiety to
please her, he furnished his ancestral castle anew,
and sent to Germany for musicians, fearing that the
rude voices of Danish singers might sound harsh in
her ears. A young Fleming, Cornelius Scepperus,
was appointed to be his private secretary, and the
Fuggers of Antwerp were invited to found a bank at
Copenhagen. At the same time twenty-four Dutch
families, from Waterland in Holland, were brought
over in Danish ships, and induced to settle on the
island of Amager, opposite the capital, in order that
the royal table might be supplied with butter and
cheese made in the Dutch fashion. This colony,
imported by Christian II., grew and flourished, and
to this day their descendants occupy Amager, where
peasant women clad in the national costume of
short woollen skirts, blue caps, and red ribbons, are
still to be seen. Unfortunately, the influence which
Sigebritt and her daughter had acquired over the King
was too strong to be resisted. Before long they returned
to Court, and, to the indignation of Isabella's
servants, Sigebritt was appointed Mistress of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
household. Rumours of the slights to which the
young Queen was exposed soon reached the Netherlands,
and when Maximilian informed Margaret that
he intended to marry her niece Eleanor to the King
of Poland, she replied with some asperity that she
could only hope the marriage would turn out better
than that of her unhappy sister. The Emperor
expressed much surprise at these words, saying that
he considered his granddaughter to be very well
married, since the King of Denmark was a monarch
of the proudest lineage, and endowed with noble
manners and rare gifts, if his people were still somewhat
rude and barbarous.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> But, in spite of Maximilian's
protests, the reports of King Christian's misconduct
soon became too persistent to be ignored.
When, in October, 1516, Charles, who had assumed
the title of King of Spain on his grandfather Ferdinand's
death, held his first Chapter of the Golden
Fleece, the Knights with one accord refused to admit
the King of Denmark to their Order, because he was
accused of adultery and ill-treated his wife.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> At
length Maximilian was moved to take action, and
wrote to his grandson Charles in sufficiently plain
language, saying:</p>

<div class="sidenote">1513-23] ELEANOR'S ROMANCE</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The shameful life which our brother and son-in-law,
the King of Denmark, is leading with a concubine,
to the great sorrow and vexation of his wife, our
daughter and your sister, is condemned by all his
relatives; and in order to constrain him to abandon
this disorderly way of living, and be a better husband
to our said daughter, we are sending Messire Sigismund
Herbesteiner to remonstrate with him, and have
begged Duke Frederic of Saxony, his uncle, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>arranged the marriage, to send one of his servants on
the same errand. And we desire you to send one of
your chief councillors to help carry out our orders,
and induce the King to put away his concubine and
behave in a more reasonable and honourable
manner."<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></div>

<p>But none of these remonstrances produced any
effect on the misguided King. When Herbesteiner
reproached him with sacrificing the laws of God and
honour and the Emperor's friendship to a low-born
woman, he shook his fist in the imperial Envoy's face,
and bade him begone from his presence.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> At the
same time he showed his resentment in a more
dangerous way by making a treaty with France and
closing the Sound to Dutch ships. He even seized
several trading vessels on pretence that the Queen's
dowry had not been paid, and when Archbishop
Walkendorf ventured to expostulate with him on
his misconduct, banished the prelate from Court.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Isabella herself bore neglect and insults
with the same uncomplaining sweetness. But we see
how much she suffered from a private letter which
she wrote to her sister Eleanor about this time.
This attractive Princess, who at the age of eighteen
still remained unmarried, had fallen in love with her
brother's brilliant friend, Frederic, Count Palatine,
the most accomplished knight at Court, and the idol
of all the ladies. The mutual attachment between
the Palatine and the Archduchess was the talk of the
whole Court, and met with Margaret's private approval,
although it was kept a secret from Charles and
his Ministers. Eleanor confided this romantic story
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>to her absent sister, and expressed a secret hope
that the popular Count Palatine might succeed her
aunt as Regent when the young King left Brussels
for Spain. In reply Isabella sent Eleanor the
warmest congratulations on her intended marriage,
rejoicing that her sister at least would not be forced
to leave home, and would be united to a husband
whom she really loved. The poor young Queen proceeded
to lament her own sad fate in the following
strain:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is hard enough to marry a man whose face you
have never seen, whom you do not know or love, and
worse still to be required to leave home and kindred,
and follow a stranger to the ends of the earth, without
even being able to speak his language."<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote">1513-23] A LOVE-LETTER</div>

<p>She goes on to describe the misery of her life, even
though she bears the title of Queen. What is she, in
fact, but a prisoner in a foreign land? She is never
allowed to go out or appear in public, while her lord
the King spends his time in royal progresses and
hunting-parties, and amuses himself after his fashion,
apart from her. Far better would it be for Eleanor
to follow her own inclination, and choose a husband
who belongs to her own country and speaks her
language, even if he were not of kingly rank. Unfortunately,
the pretty romance which excited Isabella's
sympathy was doomed to an untimely end.
The death of Mary of Castille, Queen of Portugal, in
May, 1517, left King Emanuel a widower for the
second time. He had married two of Charles's aunts
in turn, and was now over fifty, and a hunchback
into the bargain. None the less, the plan of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>marriage between him and his niece Eleanor was now
revived, and in August these proposals reached the
young King at the seaport of Middelburg, where he
and his sister were awaiting a favourable wind to set
sail for Spain. Filled with alarm, Frederic implored
Eleanor to take a bold step, confess her love to Charles,
and seek his consent to her marriage with his old
friend. In a letter signed with his name, and still
preserved in the Archives of Simancas, the Palatine
begged his love to lose no time if she would escape
from the snare laid for them both by "the Uncle of
Portugal."</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Ma mignonne," he wrote, "si vous voulez, vous
pouvez &ecirc;tre la cause de mon bien ou de mon mal.
C'est pourquoi je vous supplie d'avoir bon courage
pour vous et pour moi. Cela peut se faire si vous
voulez. Car je suis pr&ecirc;t, et ne demande autre chose,
sinon que je sois &agrave; vous, et vous &agrave; moi."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p></div>

<p>Accordingly, on the Feast of the Assumption
Eleanor approached her brother after hearing Mass in
the abbey chapel. But while she was gathering all
her courage to speak, Charles caught sight of the
Palatine's letter in her bosom, and, snatching it from
his sister's hands, broke into furious reproaches,
swearing that he would avenge this insult with the
traitor's blood. As Spinelli, the English Envoy,
remarked, "The letter was but honest, concerning
matters of love and marriage,"<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> but the young King
would listen to no excuses, and, in spite of the Regent's
intervention, Frederic was banished from Court in
disgrace. A fortnight later Charles and his sister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>sailed for Castille, and in the following summer
Madame Leonore became the bride of "l'Oncle de
Portugal," King Emanuel.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The death of Christian II.'s mistress, Dyveke, in
the summer of 1517 produced a change in the situation
at Copenhagen. This unfortunate girl, a victim of
her ambitious mother's designs, died very suddenly
one afternoon after eating cherries in the royal
gardens. The King's suspicions fell on his steward,
Torben Axe, who was brutally put to death in spite
of his protestations of innocence. But the Queen's
position was distinctly improved. Christian now
treated his wife with marked kindness, and appointed
her Regent when, early in the following year, he went
to Sweden to put down a rising of the nobles.
Sigebritt Willems's influence, however, still remained
paramount, and, in a letter to the Queen from Sweden,
Christian begged her to consult the Dutchwoman in
any difficulty, and ended by wishing her and "Mother
Sigebritt" a thousand good-nights. Stranger still to
relate, when, on the 21st of February, Isabella gave
birth to a son, the infant Prince was entrusted to
Sigebritt's care.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1513-23] BIRTH OF PRINCES</div>

<p>This happy event, combined with Isabella's unfailing
affection for her wayward lord, led to improved
relations between Christian and his wife's family.
After the death of Maximilian, Charles became anxious
to secure his brother-in-law's support in the imperial
election, and in February, 1519, a treaty was concluded
between the two monarchs at Brussels.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>The Danish Envoys, Anton de Metz and Hermann
Willems, Sigebritt's brother, received rich presents
from Margaret, who was once more acting as Regent
of the Netherlands, and she even sent a silver-gilt
cup to the hated Dutchwoman herself.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> A month
later the King of Denmark was elected Knight of the
Golden Fleece at a Chapter of the Order held at
Barcelona, and in a letter which Charles addressed to
him he expressed his pleasure at hearing good accounts
of his sister and little nephew, and promised to pay
the arrears of Isabella's dowry as soon as possible.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p>On the 28th of June, 1519, Charles was elected King
of the Romans, and the formal announcement of his
election was brought to Barcelona by Eleanor's
rejected suitor, the Palatine Frederic, whom he received
with open arms. A few days after this
auspicious event the Queen of Denmark, on the 4th of
July, 1519, gave birth to twin sons, who received the
names of Philip and Maximilian. Both, however,
died within a week of their baptism, upon which
Sigebritt is said to have remarked that this was a
good thing, since Denmark was too small a realm to
support so many Princes.</p>

<p>With the help of Dutch ships and gold, Christian
succeeded in subduing the Swedish rebels, and was
crowned with great solemnity in the Cathedral of
Upsala on the 4th of November, 1520. But the
rejoicings on this occasion were marred by the execution
of ninety Swedish nobles and two Bishops, who
were treacherously put to death by the King's orders.
This act, which earned for Christian the title of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Nero of the North, is said to have been instigated by
Sigebritt and her nephew Slagb&ouml;k, a Westphalian
barber, who had been raised from this low estate to
be Archbishop of Lunden. The insolent conduct of
these evil counsellors naturally increased the King's
unpopularity in all parts of the kingdom. Yet at
the same time Christian II. showed himself to be an
excellent and enlightened ruler. He administered
justice strictly, and introduced many salutary reforms.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1513-23] BIRTH OF DOROTHEA</div>

<p>The common practice of buying and selling serfs was
prohibited, Burgomasters and Town Councils were
appointed to carry out the laws, and a system of
tolls and customs was established. Schools and hospitals
were founded, inns were opened in every town
and village for the convenience of travellers, piracy
and brigandage were sternly repressed. An Act was
passed ordering that all cargoes recovered from
wrecks were to be placed in the nearest church, and,
if not claimed by the end of the year, divided between
the Crown and the Church. When the Bishops
complained of the loss thus inflicted on them, the
King told them to go home and learn the Eighth
Commandment. Still greater was the opposition
aroused when he attempted to reform clerical abuses.
Early in life Christian showed strong leanings towards
the doctrines of Luther, and on his return from
Sweden he asked his uncle, the Elector of Saxony,
to send him a Lutheran preacher from Wittenberg.
Although these efforts at proselytizing met with little
success, the King openly professed his sympathy with
the new Gospel. He had the Bible translated into
Danish, bade the Bishops dismiss their vast households,
issued edicts allowing priests to marry, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
ordered the begging friars to stay at home and earn
their bread by honest labour.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>All these reforms could not be effected without
vigorous opposition, and the discontent among the
nobles and clergy became every day more active. In
the spring of 1521 a young Swedish noble, Gustavus
Wasa, raised the standard of revolt in Dalecarlia, and
led his peasant bands against Stockholm. Upon this
Christian decided to pay a visit to the Low Countries
to meet the new Emperor, who was coming to be
crowned at Aix-la-Chapelle, and seek his help against
the citizens of L&uuml;beck and the Swedish rebels. The
government was once more placed in the hands of
Isabella. A few months before this, on the 10th of
November, 1520, while Christian was absent in
Sweden, the Queen had given birth to a daughter,
named Dorothea after the King's grandmother, the
able and ambitious Princess of Brandenburg, who
married two Kings of Denmark in succession. Now
she followed her husband with wistful thoughts as he
started on his journey, attended only by his Chamberlain,
Anton de Metz, and three servants, and rode all
the way to her old home in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>On the 20th of June nine Danish ships sailed into the
port of Antwerp, and a few days afterwards Christian II.
rode into the town. His fine presence and the courage
which he had shown in riding through Germany with
this small escort excited general admiration.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I noted," wrote Albert D&uuml;rer in his Journal,
"how much the people of Antwerp marvelled at the
sight of this manly and handsome Prince, who had
come hither through his enemies' country, with these
few attendants."<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote">1513-23] KING CHRISTIAN AT BRUSSELS</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>The Nuremberg master had been spending the
winter in the Low Countries, paying his respects to
the Regent at Malines, and conversing with Erasmus
of Rotterdam and Lucas van Leyden. He was
starting on his journey home, when, on the Feast
of the Visitation, he was sent for by the King of
Denmark, who received him very graciously, and
asked him to dine at his table and to take his portrait.
So great was the interest which Christian showed in
the painter's work, that D&uuml;rer gave him a fine set
of his prints, which are still preserved in the museum
at Copenhagen, and accepted an invitation to accompany
him to Brussels the next day. Thus Albert
D&uuml;rer was a witness of the meeting between Christian
and his brother-in-law Charles V., who had just arrived
from his coronation at Aix-la-Chapelle, and had been
received with great rejoicing by his subjects. At
five that summer evening Charles rode out from
Brussels at the head of a brilliant cavalcade, and
met his royal brother-in-law in a meadow, where
they embraced each other and conversed with the
help of an interpreter, Christian speaking in German,
and Charles in French. They entered Brussels after
sunset, and found the streets hung with tapestries
and lighted with innumerable torches and bonfires.
The Emperor escorted Christian to the Count of
Nassau's palace on the top of the hill, which D&uuml;rer
describes as the finest house that he had ever seen.
The next morning Charles brought his guest to the
palace gates, where the Regent and Germaine de
Foix, King Ferdinand's widow, were awaiting them,
and for the first time Margaret came face to face
with her niece's husband. Christian kissed the two
ladies in French fashion, and after dinner the two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Princes spent the evening dancing with the Court
ladies.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Now," wrote the Venetian Ambassador, Gaspare
Contarini, "at two hours after dark, they are still
dancing, for young monarchs such as these are not
easily tired."<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p></div>

<p>The impression which the Danish King made on the
learned Italian was very favourable. He describes
him as a fine-looking Prince, with an earnest, animated
expression, long locks, and a beard curled after
the Italian fashion. In his black satin doublet,
Spanish cloak, and jewelled cap, he looked every
inch a King. On the Sunday after his arrival
Christian entertained the Emperor, the Lady Margaret,
and the Queen-Dowager of Spain, at dinner.
Albert D&uuml;rer was present on this occasion, and was
afterwards employed to paint a portrait of the King
in oils, for which Christian gave him thirty florins,
an act of liberality which contrasted favourably with
Margaret's parsimony. "The Lady Margaret in particular,"
remarks the painter in his Journal, "gave
me nothing for what I made and presented to her."
Another personage in whose society the King took
pleasure was Erasmus, who discussed the reform of
the Church with him, and was much struck by the
monarch's enlightened opinions. On the 12th of July
Christian accompanied his brother-in-law to Antwerp,
to lay the foundations of the new choir of Our Lady's
Church, and went on to Ghent, where he paid formal
homage for the duchy of Holstein, and was confirmed
in his rights over the Hanse towns, but could not
persuade Charles to join him in making war on the
friendly citizens of L&uuml;beck. At Ghent the King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
sent for the English Ambassador, Sir Robert Wingfield,
with whom he had a long and friendly conversation,
expressing great anxiety to meet King Henry VIII.
In reply, Wingfield told him that he would soon have
the opportunity of seeing the English monarch's
powerful Minister, Cardinal Wolsey, to whom he
could speak as frankly as to the King himself.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Accordingly, on the 5th of August Christian accompanied
Charles and Margaret to the Prinzenhof at
Bruges, where Wolsey joined them a week later.
The regal state of the English Cardinal formed a
striking contrast to the King's simplicity. He arrived
with a train of over a thousand followers, clad in
red satin, and twenty English nobles, wearing gold
chains, walked at his horse's side. On Sunday he
rode to Mass with the Emperor, and dined with Charles
and Margaret, "praising the delicate and sumptuous
manner" in which he was entertained. When the
King of Denmark sent to ask him to come to his
lodgings, the Cardinal demurred, saying that, as he
represented His Majesty of England, the King must
be the first to visit him, but that if Christian preferred
he would meet him in the palace garden. Christian,
however, waived ceremony, and called on Wolsey the
next morning. The interview was a very friendly
one. Christian expressed his anxiety to enter into a
close alliance with England, and begged King Henry
to be a good uncle to his young kinsman, James V. of
Scotland. Wolsey on his part was much impressed
by the King's good sense and peaceable intentions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1513-23] REVOLT IN DENMARK</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Surely, Sir," he wrote to his royal master, "the
King of Denmark, though in appearance he should
be judged to be a rash man, yet he is right wise, sober,
and discreet, minding the establishing of good peace
betwixt Christian Princes, wherein he right substantially
declared his mind to me at good length."<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>But the next day the King sent the Cardinal word
that he had received such bad news from his own
country that he must return without delay. He
actually left Bruges that day, and was escorted to the
city gates by the Papal Nuncio Caracciolo and Contarini,
who took leave of the King, and returned to
dine with Erasmus and his English friend, <i>Messer
Toma Moro</i>.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Unfortunately, Christian's visit to
the Low Countries produced no good result, and there
was some justification for the Imperial Chancellor's
cynical remark: "It would have been better to keep
the King here, where he can do no harm, than to let
him go home to make fresh mischief."<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> He left
Bruges dissatisfied with the Emperor, and on reaching
Copenhagen his first act was to dismiss the Queen's
confessor, Mansueri. When the Emperor begged
him to leave his sister free in matters of conscience,
he broke into a passionate fit of rage, tore the Golden
Fleece from his neck, and trampled it underfoot,
cursing his meddlesome brother-in-law. What was
worse, he seized several Dutch ships in the Sound,
and drew upon himself the serious displeasure of the
Regent and her Council.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Gustavus Wasa had laid siege to Stockholm,
and there was a rising in Jutland. A Papal
Legate arrived at Copenhagen to inquire into the
judicial murder of the Swedish Bishops and demand
the punishment of Slagb&ouml;k. The unfortunate Arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>bishop
was made a scapegoat, and put to death in
January, 1522. Stones were thrown at Sigebritt
when she drove out in the royal carriage, and one day
she was thrown into a pond by some peasants, and
only rescued with difficulty. Even Christian began
to realize the danger of the situation, and wrote to
Isabella from Jutland, begging her to "bid Mother
Sigebritt hold her tongue, and not set foot outside
the castle, if she wished him to return home alive."
In another letter, written on the 4th of February,
1522, from the Convent of Dalin, the King congratulates
his wife on her safe deliverance, and the birth
of "a marvellously handsome child."<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> This is the
only intimation we have of the birth of Isabella's
second daughter, Christina. The exact date is not
to be found in the Danish archives, and has hitherto
eluded all research. The child who saw the light in
these troubled times received the name of Christina
from her grandmother, the Queen-Dowager of Denmark,
a Princess of Saxon birth, who still resided at
King Hans's favourite palace of Odensee. All we know
of Queen Christina is that, on the 2nd of April, 1515,
two years after her husband's death, she addressed
an urgent prayer to King Henry VIII., begging him
to send her a relic of St. Thomas of Canterbury.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
We are not told if a phial containing a drop of the
saint's blood was sent to Denmark in response to
this entreaty, but the request is of interest as a proof
of the English martyr's widespread renown.</p>

<p>A few weeks after the birth of her little daughter
Isabella wrote a touching appeal to her aunt, imploring
the Regent's help against the Danish rebels:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1513-23] CHRISTIAN II. DEPOSED</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We have sad news from my lord in Jutland.
The nobles there have rebelled against him, and seek
to deprive him and our children of their crown and
their lives. So we entreat you to come to our help,
that we may chastise these rebels."<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p></div>

<p>Anton de Metz was sent to Brussels on the same
errand, but could obtain small hopes of assistance.
The Regent's Council complained that King Christian
had damaged the trade of the Low Countries and ill-treated
their sailors, and the temper of the Court was
reflected in Sir Robert Wingfield's despatches to
England.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Easterlings," remarked the Ambassador,
"handle the King of Denmark roughly, and his own
people are said to have killed the Woman of Holland,
who was mother to his Dove, as the King's mistress
was called, whereby it appeareth that ill life and like
governance often cometh to a bad end."<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p></div>

<p>King Christian's affairs, as Wingfield truly said,
were in an evil plight. In June Stockholm surrendered
to Gustavus Wasa, and the citizens of L&uuml;beck
sent a fleet to burn Helsingfors and threaten Copenhagen.
To add to the unfortunate King's difficulties,
his uncle Frederic, Duke of Holstein, who had always
nursed a grievance against his elder brother, the late
King Hans, now took up a hostile attitude, and
made common cause with the rebels. On the 20th of
January, 1523, the nobles of Jutland met at Viborg,
deposed Christian II. formally, and elected his uncle
Frederic to be King in his stead. In vain Christian
endeavoured to raise fresh forces, and sent desperate
appeals to his kinsfolk in the Low Countries and
Germany, and to his allies in England and Scotland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>Margaret replied curtly that the Emperor himself
needed all the men and ammunition that could be
obtained in those parts. The young King of Scotland's
Chancellor, the Archbishop of Glasgow, sent
a sympathetic message, regretting that the enmity of
England prevented him from helping King Christian
against his rebel subjects. When the Dean of
Roskild appeared in London with a letter from the
Danish monarch, begging King Henry to induce
Margaret to help him against the Easterlings, Wolsey
sent a splendid barge to conduct the Ambassador to
Greenwich, but gave him little encouragement beyond
fair words. "So I hope," wrote Sir Robert Wingfield,
who, in spite of Christian's civilities at Ghent, had little
pity for him, "that this wicked King will fail."<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1513-23] FLIGHT OF THE ROYAL FAMILY</div>

<p>The unhappy monarch was at his wits' end. Yet
many of his subjects were still loyal. The bulk of the
middle and lower classes, the burghers, artisans, and
country-folk, looked on him as their best friend; and
when he appeared at the fair of Ringsted, a thousand
strong arms were raised, and a thousand lusty voices
swore fealty to Christian, the peasants' King. Copenhagen
was strongly fortified, and as long as he stayed
there he was safe from his foes. But an unaccountable
panic seized him. Whether, as in the case of
Lodovico Sforza, whom he resembled in so many
ways, remorse for past crimes enfeebled his will, or
whether his nerves gave way, he could not summon
up courage to meet his foes, and decided to fly. A
fleet of twenty ships was equipped, fully supplied
with arms and ammunition, and laden with the crown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>jewels, archives, and treasures. The Queen and her
young children&mdash;the five-year-old Prince John, the
two little Princesses, Dorothea and Christina (a babe
of fifteen months)&mdash;went on board the finest vessel of
the fleet, the <i>Great Mary</i>, and Mother Sigebritt was
hidden in a chest to save her from the fury of the
people, who regarded her as the chief cause of the
King's unpopularity. But the greatest compassion
was felt for Isabella and her innocent babes; and
even the usurper Frederic wrote to beg the Queen
to remain in Denmark, assuring her that she and her
children would be perfectly safe. On the 14th of
April the fleet set sail. An immense crowd assembled
on the ramparts to see the last of the royal
family. The King made a farewell speech, exhorting
the garrison to remain loyal to his cause, and promising
to return in three months with reinforcements.
Then the ships weighed anchor, and neither Isabella
nor her children ever saw the shores of Denmark
again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] VISIT TO LONDON</div>

<p>The troubles of the Danish royal family were not
over when they left Copenhagen. A violent storm
scattered the fleet in the North Sea, and drove several
of the ships on the Norwegian coast, where many of
them were lost with all their cargo. The remaining
eleven or twelve ships entered the harbour of Veeren,
in Walcheren, on the 1st of May. Here the King and
Queen were kindly received by Adolf of Burgundy,
the Admiral of the Dutch fleet, who kept them for a
week in his own house, and then escorted them to the
Regent's Court at Malines. Margaret welcomed her
niece with all her old affection, and took her and the
royal children into her own house. But she met the
King's prayer for help coldly, saying that it was
beyond her power to give him either men or money.
The moment, it is true, was singularly unpropitious.
Not only were all the Emperor's resources needed to
carry on his deadly struggle with France, but nearer
home the Regent was engaged in a fierce conflict
with her old enemy, Charles of Guelders, for the
possession of Friesland. As Adolf of Burgundy wrote
to Wolsey: "We need help so much ourselves that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
we are hardly in condition to help others."<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Christian
soon realized this, and determined to apply to
Henry VIII., relying on his former assurances of
brotherly affection, and feeling confident of Wolsey's
support. The scheme met with Margaret's approval,
and, since Isabella had only brought one Dutch maid
and the children's nurses from Copenhagen, the
Regent lent her several ladies, in order that she
might appear in due state at the English Court.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>On the 5th of June the King and Queen left Malines
with a suite of eighty persons and fifty horses, and,
after waiting some time at Calais to hear the latest
news from Denmark, crossed the Channel, and reached
Greenwich on the 19th. Wolsey had already told
the Imperial Ambassador, De Praet, that the King
of Denmark would receive little encouragement from
his master, and had expressed a hope that he would
not give them the trouble of coming to England.
He met the royal travellers, however, at the riverside,
and conducted them to the palace, where they dined
in the great hall with the King on the following day,
Henry leading Christian by the hand, and Queen
Katherine following with Isabella and her sister-in-law,
Mary, Duchess of Suffolk, the widow of
Louis XII., who was still known as <i>la Reine blanche</i>.
From Greenwich the King and Queen of Denmark
moved to Bath Place, where they were lodged at
Henry's expense. Katherine welcomed her great-niece
with motherly affection, but both Henry and Wolsey
told Christian plainly that he had made a fatal mistake
in deserting his loyal subjects, and advised him to
return at once and encourage them by his presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>All the English monarch would do was to send Envoys
to Denmark to urge the usurper Frederic and his
supporters to return to their allegiance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For," as Henry himself wrote to the Emperor,
"this perfidy of the King's subjects is a most fatal
example, if for the most trifling cause a Prince is to
be called in question, and expelled and put from his
crown."<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p></div>

<p>The futility of these measures was evident to
De Praet, who wrote to Charles at Toledo, saying
that unless he took up the exiled monarch's cause for
his sister's sake he would never recover his kingdom.
Copenhagen was now besieged by land and sea, and
if the garrison were not relieved by Michaelmas they
would be forced to surrender, and Christian's last
hope would be gone. The King himself, De Praet
owned, seemed little changed, and he advised the
Emperor to insist on Sigebritt's removal before giving
him any help.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Your Majesty," wrote the Ambassador, "ought
first of all to have the Woman of Holland sought out
and punished, an act which in my small opinion would
acquire great merit in the eyes of both God and man."<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p></div>

<p>At Isabella's request, both Margaret and King Henry
had spoken strongly to Christian on this subject, but
he still persisted in his infatuation, and it was not
till after he had left the Netherlands, and his wife and
aunt were dead, that this miserable woman was
arrested in Ghent and burnt as a witch.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] A NOBLE WIFE</div>

<p>As for the Queen, no words could express De Praet's
admiration for her angelic goodness. "It is indeed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>grievous," he wrote, "to see this poor lady in so
melancholy a plight, and I cannot marvel too much
at her virtues and heroic patience." Henry was
equally moved, and wrote to Charles in the warmest
terms of his sister's noble qualities, but did not
disguise his contempt for her husband.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>There was, clearly, nothing more to be gained by
remaining in England, and on the 5th of July the King
and Queen returned to the Low Countries. Isabella
joined her children at Malines, and Christian went to
Antwerp to equip ships for the relief of Copenhagen.
But he soon quarrelled with Margaret, and left suddenly
for Germany. In September he appeared at
Berlin, having ridden from Brussels attended by only
two servants, and succeeded in raising a force of
25,000 men, with the help of his brother-in-law, the
Marquis of Brandenburg, and Duke Henry of Brunswick.
But when the troops assembled on the banks
of the Elbe, King Christian was unable to fulfil his
promises or provide the money demanded by the
leaders, and he was glad to escape with his life from
the angry hordes of soldiers clamouring for pay.
By the end of the year Copenhagen capitulated, and
in the following August the usurper Frederic was
elected King by the General Assembly, and solemnly
crowned in the Frauenkirche.<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The crimes of the unhappy
Christian recoiled on his own head, and in the
Act of Deprivation by which he was formally deposed,
it was expressly stated that his neglect of his noble
and virtuous wife, and infatuation for the adventuress
Sigebritt and her daughter, had estranged the hearts
of his people. But through all these troubles Isabella
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>clung to him with unchanging faithfulness. She
followed him first to Berlin, then to Saxony, where
he sought his uncle's help. In March she went to
Nuremberg on a visit to her brother, King Ferdinand,
and pleaded her husband and children's cause before
the Diet in so eloquent a manner that the assembled
Princes were moved to tears.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Everyone here," wrote Hannart, the minister
whom Charles V. had sent to his sister's help, "is
full of compassion for the Queen, but no one places
the least trust in the King. If it were not for her
sake, not a single man would saddle a horse on his
behalf."</p></div>

<p>Hannart, in fact, confessed that he had done his
utmost to keep Christian away from Nuremberg,
feeling sure that his presence would do more harm
than good. Even Isabella's entreaties were of no
avail. She begged her brother in vain for the loan of
20,000 florins to satisfy the Duke of Brunswick, whose
angry threats filled her with alarm.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am always afraid some harm may happen to
you when I am away," she wrote to her husband.
"I long to join you, and would rather suffer at your
side than live in comfort away from you."<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p></div>

<p>But Christian, as Hannart remarked in a letter to
the Regent Margaret, had few friends. Even his
servants did not attempt to deny the charges that
were brought against him, and the Queen alone, like
the loyal wife that she was, sought to explain and
excuse his conduct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] MARTIN LUTHER</div>

<p>To add to Isabella's troubles, her brother Ferdinand
was seriously annoyed at the leanings to the Lutheran
faith which she now displayed. Christian's Protestant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>tendencies had been greatly strengthened by his residence
in Saxony during the winter of 1523. He
heard Luther preach at Wittenberg, and spent much
time in his company, dining frequently with him and
Spalatin, the Court chaplain, and making friends with
the painter Lucas Cranach. The fine portrait of King
Christian by this artist forms the frontispiece of a
Danish version of the New Testament published by
Hans Mikkelsen, the Burgomaster of Malmo&euml;, who
shared his royal master's exile. When the Marquis
Joachim of Brandenburg remonstrated with his
brother-in-law for his intimacy with the heretic Luther,
Christian replied that he would rather lose all three of
his kingdoms than forsake this truly Apostolic man.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
Isabella's naturally religious nature was deeply impressed
by these new influences, and both she and
her sister-in-law, Elizabeth of Brandenburg, secretly
embraced the reformed doctrine. At Nuremberg
she attended the sermons of the Lutheran doctor
Osiander, and received Communion in both kinds
from his hands on Maundy Thursday, to the great
indignation of King Ferdinand, who told her he could
not own a heretic as his sister. Isabella replied gently
that if he cast her off God would take care of her.
Luther on his part was moved by the apparent
sincerity of his royal convert.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Strange indeed are the ways of God!" he wrote
to Spalatin. "His grace penetrates into the most
unlikely places, and may even bring this rare wild
game, a King and Queen, safely into the heavenly
net."<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>While Luther addressed a strong remonstrance to
the newly-elected King of Denmark and the citizens
of L&uuml;beck, Christian's Chancellor, Cornelius Scepperus,
drew up an eloquent memorial to Pope Clement VII.
on the exiled King's behalf, and travelled to Spain to
seek the Emperor's help. By Hannart's exertions a
Congress was held at Hamburg in April, which was
attended by representatives of the Emperor, the
Regent of the Netherlands, the Imperial Electors and
Princes, as well as by deputies from Denmark,
England, Poland, and L&uuml;beck. Isabella accompanied
her husband on this occasion, at Hannart's request.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I hear on all sides," he wrote to Charles, "that
the people of Denmark would gladly welcome the
return of the Queen and her children if the King
would not meddle with public affairs, and a good
Governor appointed by Your Majesty should act as
Regent until the young Prince is of age."<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p></div>

<p>But when, by way of compromise, some members
of the Congress proposed that Frederic should retain
the throne, and recognize Prince John as his successor,
Christian rejected this offer angrily, and negotiations
were soon broken off. Both Charles and Margaret
now gave up all hope of effecting Christian's restoration,
and concluded a treaty in the following August
with King Frederic, by which his title was recognized,
and the Baltic was once more opened to the merchants
of the Low Countries.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] THE CHILDREN OF DENMARK</div>

<p>The exiled monarch, now compelled to realize
the hopelessness of his cause, returned sorrowfully
with his wife to the Low Countries, and Isabella had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>at least the joy of embracing her children once more.
During this long absence the faithful servants who had
followed their King and Queen into exile had kept
her well supplied with news of their health and
progress.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Prince John," wrote Nicolas Petri, Canon of
Lunden, "learns quickly, and begins to speak French.
He is already a great favourite with the Lady Margaret.
His sisters, the Princesses, are very well, and
are both very pretty children. The youngest, Madame
Christine, has just been weaned. Madame Marguerite
says that she will soon be receiving proposals of
marriage for the elder one. These are good omens,
for which God be praised. It is a real pleasure to be
with these children, they are so good and charming.
If only Your Grace could see them, you would soon
forget all your troubles."<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p></div>

<p>But not all Margaret's affection for Isabella and
her children could reconcile her to the King's presence.
Christian was, it must be confessed, a troublesome
guest. His restless brain was always busy with new
plots and intrigues. At first he announced his intention
of taking Isabella to visit the Emperor in Spain,
but, after spending some weeks in Zeeland fitting out
ships, he suddenly changed his mind, and took Isabella,
whose health had suffered from all the hardships and
anxiety that she had undergone, to drink the waters
at Aix-la-Chapelle. On his return he wished to settle
at Ghent, but the Regent and her Council, fearing
that his presence would excite sedition in this city,
suggested that the Castle of Gemappes should be
offered him instead. Charles replied that if the King
lived at Gemappes he would certainly spoil his
hunting, and thought that Lille or Bruges would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
a better place. In the end Lierre, a pleasant city
halfway between Malines and Antwerp, was chosen
for the exiled Princes' home. Towards the end of
1524 Christian and his family took up their abode in
the old castle which still goes by the name of <i>Het Hof
van Denemarken</i>, or <i>Cour de Danemarck</i>. A guard of
fifty halberdiers and a considerable household was
assigned to them by the Emperor's order. A monthly
allowance of 500 crowns was granted to the King,
while the Queen received a yearly sum of 2,000 crowns
<i>pour employer en ses menus plaisirs</i>. But Christian's
reckless and disorderly conduct soon landed him in
fresh difficulties. Isabella cut up her husband's old
robes to make clothes for her little girls, and was
reduced to such penury that she was compelled to
pledge, not only her jewels, but the children's toys.
Meanwhile Margaret's letters to her imperial nephew
were filled with complaints of the Danish King's
extravagance. She declared that he was spending
800 crowns a month, and perpetually asking for more.
When she sent her <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, Monsieur de
Souvastre, to set his affairs in order, he was confronted
with a long list of unpaid bills from doctors,
apothecaries, saddlers, masons, carpenters, tailors,
and poulterers. But accounts of the straits to which
the Queen and her children were reduced had evidently
reached Spain, and Charles felt it necessary to
remind his aunt gently that, after all, Isabella was
his own sister, and that many pensioners whom he
had never seen received many thousands of crowns a
year from his purse.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] A ZEALOUS LUTHERAN</div>

<p>Another cause of perpetual irritation was the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>favour shown by the King to the Lutherans, whom the
Regent was trying to drive out of Flanders. The
Court of Lierre became the refuge of all who professed
the new doctrine. Margaret insisted on the
banishment of several of the King's servants, including
the chaplain, Hans Monbo&euml;, and Prince John's tutor,
Nicolas Petri, and sent others to prison. But these
high-handed acts only strengthened Christian's zeal
in the cause of reform. "The word of God," he wrote
to his friend Spalatin, "waxes powerful in the Netherlands,
and thrives on the blood of the martyrs."<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
The letters which he addressed to his old subjects
were couched in the same strain. He confessed his
past sins, and prayed that he might be restored to
his kingdom, like David of old, declaring that his
sole wish was to live for Christ and do good to his
enemies. At the same time he hired freebooters to
ravage the coast of Denmark, and provoked King
Frederic to close the Sound, an act which aroused
widespread discontent in the Low Countries. In
August, 1525, he sent a herald to England, begging
King Henry and his good friend the Cardinal to
intercede with the Regent, and induce her to lend
him men and money for a fresh expedition. But
Margaret turned a deaf ear to all entreaties, and
when Isabella's physician recommended her to try
the waters of Aix-la-Chapelle again, she declined to
sanction this journey on the score of expense. She
sent her own doctor, however, to Lierre, and at his
suggestion the invalid was moved for change of air
to Swynaerde, the Abbot of St. Peter's country-house
near Ghent. But Isabella's ills were beyond the
reach of human skill, and she soon became too weak
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>to leave her room. On the 12th of December
Christian sent for his old chaplain from Wittenberg,
begging him to return without delay.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother in Christ</span>," he wrote,<br />
</p>

<p>"Here we forget Christ, and have no one to
preach the word of God. I implore you to come and
give us the comfort of the Gospel. Greet our brothers
and sisters."</p></div>

<p>Upon receiving this summons, Monbo&euml; and Hans
Mikkelsen hastened to Ghent, at the peril of their
lives, and administered spiritual consolation to the
dying Queen. On the 19th of January she received
the last Sacraments from the priest of Swynaerde, and
saw Monsieur de Souvastre, by whom she sent her
aunt affectionate messages, commending her poor
children to Margaret's care. A few hours afterwards
she passed quietly away. Both Catholics and Lutherans
bore witness to her angelic patience, and a letter
which Christian addressed to Luther, ten days later,
gives a touching account of his wife's last moments:</p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] DEATH OF ISABELLA</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As her weakness increased, Frau Margaret sent
her servant, Philippe de Souvastre, and other excellent
persons, to admonish her after the fashion of the
Popish Anti-Christ's faith and the religion of his sect.
But Almighty God in His mercy deprived my wife
of her powers of speech, so that she made no reply,
and they gave up speaking, and only anointed her
with oil. But before this she had received the Blessed
Sacrament in the most devout manner, with ardent
longing, firm faith, and stedfast courage; and when
one of our preachers exhorted her, in the words of
the Gospel, to stand fast in the faith, she confessed
her firm trust in God, and paid no heed to the superstitious
mutterings of the others. After this she
became speechless, but gave many signs of true faith
to the end, and took her last farewell of this world
on the 19th of January. May God Almighty be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>gracious to her soul, and grant her eternal rest! We
are strong in the sure and certain hope that she has
entered into eternal bliss, unto which God bring us
all!"<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p></div>

<p>On the 4th of February the dead Queen, who had
not yet completed her twenty-fifth year, was buried
with great pomp in the cloisters of the Abbey of
St. Peter at Ghent, where a stately marble tomb was
raised over her ashes. The painter Mabuse was employed
to design the monument, as we learn from a
letter which the King addressed to the Abbot of
St. Peter's in 1528, complaining of his delay in completing
the work. A Latin inscription by Cornelius
Scepperus, giving Isabella's titles in full, and recording
her virtues and the sufferings which she had endured
during her short life, was placed on the monument,
which is described by an English traveller of the
sixteenth century, Philip Skippon.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Unfortunately,
the tomb was rifled by the mob at the time of
the French Revolution, but the ashes of the Queen
were carefully preserved by a pious Cur&eacute;, and afterwards
restored to their former resting-place.</p>

<p>Isabella's early death was deeply lamented, not
only in the Low Countries, where she was so beloved,
but in her husband's kingdoms. Funeral services were
held throughout the land, and all men wept for the
good Princess "who had been the mother of her
people." On all sides testimonies to her worth were
paid. Henry of England wrote to King Christian
that the late Queen had been as dear to him as a
sister, and Luther paid an eloquent tribute to her
memory in his treatise on Holy Women:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Of such Kings' daughters there was indeed one,
of the noblest birth, Isabella, Queen of Denmark, a
Princess of the royal house of Spain. She embraced
the Gospel with great ardour, and confessed the faith
openly. And because of this she died in want and
misery. For had she consented to renounce her faith,
she would have received far more help and much
greater kindness in this life."<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p></div>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>The news of the Queen of Denmark's death reached
her brother, the Emperor, on the eve of his marriage
to Isabella of Portugal. Guillaume des Barres, the
bearer of Margaret's letters, found him at a village
in Andalusia, on his way to Seville, where the wedding
was to take place on the following day, and had a long
interview with his imperial master before he left his
bed on the 9th of March. Charles spoke with deep feeling
of his sister, and inquired anxiously if the Regent
had been able to obtain possession of her children&mdash;"a
thing," wrote Des Barres, "which His Majesty
desires greatly, because of the King's heretical leanings."<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] MARGARET INTERVENES</div>

<p>Margaret had certainly not been remiss in this
matter. But Christian was more intractable than
ever. He took his children to Ghent immediately
after their mother's death, and refused to give them
up until the Regent had paid all his debts, including
7,000 florins for the funeral expenses, and 2,000 more
which he owed to the landlord of the Falcon at Lierre
for Rhine-wine and fodder. His language became
every day more violent. He threatened to cut off
the Governor of Antwerp's head, and appealed to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>comrades of the Golden Fleece for the redress of his
supposed grievances. At length Margaret, seeing that
none of her Court officials and Councillors could bring
him to reason, rode to Lierre herself on the 2nd of
March, and made a last attempt to obtain possession
of the children <i>par voye aimable</i>. The King, she
found, had already packed up his furniture and plate,
even the chalice which was used in the royal chapel,
and was about to start for Germany.</p>

<p>After prolonged discussion, the Regent succeeded
in persuading Christian to leave his children with her,
on condition that she paid his debts in Lierre, and
provided for the late Queen's funeral expenses&mdash;"a
thing which must be done," she wrote to Charles,
"out of sheer decency." But she quite refused the
King's demand for an increased allowance, saying
that he could not require more money than he had
received in his wife's lifetime. Christian then left the
Netherlands for Saxony, saying that he intended to
raise a fresh army and invade Denmark. "He is
confident of recovering his kingdoms," wrote Margaret
to the Emperor, "but my own impression is that his
exploits will be confined to plundering and injuring
your subjects." This prophecy was literally fulfilled,
and during the next four years the peaceful folk in
Friesland were harassed by turbulent freebooters in
the King of Denmark's pay, while pirates ravaged
the coasts of the North Sea, and led the Hanse cities
to make severe reprisals on the Dutch ships.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] THE PALACE OF MALINES</div>

<p>Margaret's chief object, however, was attained.
On the 5th of March she returned to Malines with
the Prince of Denmark and his little sisters. "Henceforth,
Monseigneur," she wrote to Charles, "you will
have to be both father and mother to these poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
children, and must treat them as your own."<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The
Regent herself nobly fulfilled the sacred trust committed
to her by the dying Queen. From this time
until her own death, four and a half years later,
Isabella's children were the objects of her unceasing
care, and lacked nothing that money could provide
or love suggest. They lived under her own roof in
the Palace of Malines, that city of wide streets and
canals, with the fine market-place and imposing
cathedral, which many called the finest town in
Flanders. Margaret's first care was to arrange the
royal children's household. Prince John was placed
in the charge of a governess, Mademoiselle Rolande
de Serclaes, who superintended his meals and taught
him "Christian religion and good manners," while
he had for his tutor Cornelius Agrippa, the distinguished
scholar and defender of women's rights,
who dedicated his book, "On the Pre-excellence of
Women," to the Regent. In Lent the Prince and his
sisters received regular instruction in the palace
chapel, and one year Friar Jehan de Salis received
thirty-six livres for preaching a course of Lent sermons
before the Prince and Princesses of Denmark. Margaret
herself kept a watchful eye on the children. A
hundred entries in her household accounts show how
carefully she chose their nurses and companions, their
clothes and playthings. One of her first gifts to the
Prince was a handsome pony, richly harnessed with
black and gold trappings. Another was a dwarf
page, who became his constant playfellow, and in
his turn received good Ypres cloth and damask for
his own wear. Italian merchants from Antwerp
often came to lay their wares before the Regent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>We find her choosing black velvet and white satin
for Prince John's doublet, and pearl buttons and gold
fringe to trim his sleeves, and ordering the goldsmith,
Master Leonard of Augsburg, to supply an antique
silver dagger and an image of Hercules for the Prince's
cap. Or else a merchant is desired to send her two
pairs of cuffs of exquisitely fine "toile de Cambray,"
embroidered with gold thread, for the young Princesses'
wear,<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> and twenty gold balls for the fringe of
their bed. Amid all the anxious cares of State which
filled her time, this great lady seldom allowed a day
to pass without seeing her nephew and nieces. Their
innocent prattle and merry laughter cheered her
lonely hours, while the Prince and his sisters found
plenty to amuse them in their great-aunt's rooms.
The halls were hung with costly Arras tapestries of
David killing Goliath, stories of Alexander and
Esther, hunting scenes and Greek fables, or adorned
with paintings by the best masters. Van Eyck's
"Merchant of Lucca, Arnolfini with his Wife," and
"Virgin of the Fountain," Rogier Van der Weyden's
and Memling's Madonnas, Jerome Bosch's "St.
Anthony," Jacopo de' Barbari's "Crucifixion," were
all here, as well as Michel van Coxien's little Virgin
with the sleeping Child in her arms, which Margaret
called her <i>mignonne</i>.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The library contained a complete
collection of family portraits, chiefly the work
of the Court painter, Bernard van Orley or Jehan
Mabuse.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] MABUSE'S PICTURE</div>

<p>Among these were pictures of Margaret's parents,
Maximilian and Mary of Burgundy; of her second
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>husband, Monsieur de Savoie, a brilliant cavalier
clad in a crimson mantle sown with daisies in allusion
to his wife's name; and of her brother, King
Philip, with his children, the young Archduke Charles
and the future Queens of France and Denmark.
Prince John and his sisters would recognize the portraits
of their own father and mother, King Christian
and his gentle wife, which hung over the mantelpiece,
together with those of their great-grandparents,
Ferdinand and Isabella, the Kings of France and
England, and the Grand Turk. But better in the
children's eyes than all the pictures and bronzes, the
marble busts and ivories, the silver mirrors and
chandeliers, better even than the Chinese dragons
and stuffed birds-of-Paradise from the New World,
were the live pets with which their aunt loved to be
surrounded. The famous green parrot which once
belonged to Mary of Burgundy had lately died, to
her great sorrow. Margaret herself had written its
epitaph, and the Court poet, Jehan Le Maire, had
sung the bird's descent into the Elysian fields, and its
converse with Charon and Mercury, in his elegy of
"L'Amant Vert." But in its stead she had cages
full of parakeets and singing birds, which were carefully
tended by her ladies, and fed with white loaves
newly baked every morning. There was an Italian
greyhound in a white fur tippet, and a number of
toy-dogs in baskets lined with swansdown, and a
marmoset that she had bought from a French pedlar,
which afforded the Court ladies as much amusement
as the royal children. Nor were other diversions
wanting. Margaret was very fond of music, and not
only kept a troop of viol and tambourine players, but
often sent for the town band of Ghent and Brussels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
or the Prince of Orange's fife and organ players, to
beguile her evenings. Sometimes the children of
S. Rombaut and the choir-boys of Notre Dame du
Sablon in Brussels would sing chorales during dinner,
or strolling players and German marionettes, Italian
jugglers, or Poles and Hungarians with tame bears,
would be allowed to perform in her presence. On one
occasion a famous lute-player from the Court of
Whitehall was sent over by King Henry, and received
seven gold crowns for his pains. Another time three
Savoyards were rewarded with a handful of gold
pieces for the tricks with which they had amused the
Court after supper. And every May Day the archers
of the guard marched in procession to plant hawthorn-bushes
covered with blossom under the palace
windows.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>In these pleasant surroundings the children of Denmark
grew up under the same roof as their mother
and aunts before them, leading the same joyous and
natural life. No wonder that through all her troubled
life Christina looked back fondly to these early times,
and never forgot the happy days which she had spent
at Malines. There is a charming picture, now at
Hampton Court, of the three children, painted by
Mabuse soon after their mother's death, and sent
to King Henry VIII., whose favour Christian II. was
once more trying to obtain.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>The three children are standing at a table covered
with a green cloth, on which apples and cherries are
laid. Prince John, a manly boy with a thoughtful,
attractive face, wearing a black velvet suit and cap
and a gold chain round his neck, is in the centre
between his sisters. On his right, Dorothea, a pretty
child with brown eyes and golden curls frizzled all
over her head, reaches out her hand towards the
fruit, while on his left the little Christina grasps an
apple firmly in one hand, and lays the other confidingly
on her brother's arm. Both little girls are
dressed in black velvet with white ermine sleeves,
probably made out of their father's old robes. But
while Dorothea's curly head is uncovered, Christina
wears a tight-fitting hood edged with pearls, drawn
closely over her baby face. Her tiny features are
full of character, and the large brown eyes, with their
earnest gaze, and small fingers clasping the apple,
already reveal the courage and resolution for which
she was to be distinguished in days to come.</p>

<p>At this early period of their lives it was, naturally
enough, Prince John who chiefly occupied his guardian's
thoughts. A boy of rare promise, studious,
intelligent, and affectionate, he had inherited much
of his mother's charm, and soon became a great
favourite at Court. Margaret was never tired of
describing his talents and progress to the Emperor,
who took keen interest in his young nephew, and
was particularly glad to hear how fond he was of
riding.</p>

<p>When in July, 1528, Margaret's servant Montfort
was sent on an important mission to Spain, the
Emperor's first anxiety was to hear full accounts of
Prince John and his sisters from the Envoy's lips.
He expressed great satisfaction with all Montfort told
him, saying that he entertained the highest hopes of
his nephew, and would far rather support his claim
to Denmark than help his father to recover the throne&mdash;"the
more so," he added, "since we hear that King
Christian, to our sorrow, still adheres to the false
doctrine of Luther."</p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>King Christian, as the Emperor hinted, was still a
thorn in the Regent's side. Although, since his wife's
death, most of his time had been spent in Germany,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
he remained a perpetual source of annoyance. In
July, 1528, he induced his sister Elizabeth to leave
her husband, Joachim of Brandenburg, and escape
with him to Saxony. All Germany rang with this
new scandal, and while the Marquis appealed to
Margaret, begging her to stop Christian's allowance
as the only means of bringing him to his senses,
Elizabeth, who had secretly embraced the reformed
faith, implored the Emperor's protection against her
husband, and refused to return to Berlin. At the
same time the King did his utmost to stir up discontent
round Lierre, and raised bands of freebooters
in Holland, whose lawless depredations were a constant
source of vexation to Charles's loyal subjects.
When the Regent protested, he replied that he had
nothing to do with these levies, and that his intentions
were absolutely innocent, assurances which, Margaret
remarked, would not deceive a child. Under these
circumstances, relations between the two became
daily more strained. "Margaret loves me not, and
has never loved me," wrote Christian to his Lutheran
friends, while the Regent turned to Charles in her
despair, saying: "Monseigneur, if the King of Denmark
comes here, I simply do not know what I am
to do with him!"<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] DEATH OF MARGARET</div>

<p>Suddenly a new turn in the tide altered the whole
aspect of affairs. On the 3rd of August, 1529, the
Peace of Cambray was finally concluded. The long
war, which had drained the Emperor's resources,
was at an end, and his hands were once more free.
Christian lost no time in taking advantage of this
opportunity to secure his powerful kinsman's help.
He addressed urgent petitions to the Emperor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>King Ferdinand, and sent an Envoy to plead his
cause at Bologna, where on the 24th of February,
1530, Charles V. received the imperial crown from
the hands of Pope Clement VII. But the only condition
on which the exiled monarch could be admitted
into the new confederation was his return to the
Catholic Church. For this, too, Christian seems to have
been prepared. On the 2nd of February he signed
an agreement at Lierre, in which he promised to obey
the Emperor's wishes, and to hold fast the Catholic
faith, if he should be restored to the throne of Denmark.
When Charles crossed the Brenner, Christian
hastened to meet him at Innsbruck, and, throwing
himself at the foot of Cardinal Campeggio, craved the
Holy Father's pardon for his past errors, and received
absolution. But, in spite of this public recantation,
the King still secretly preferred the reformed faith,
and continued to correspond with his Lutheran friends.
On the 25th of June he arrived at Malines with letters
of credit for 24,000 florins, which he had received
from the Emperor as the price of his submission.
But the Council refused to give him a farthing without
the Regent's consent, and Margaret declined to see
him, pleading illness as her excuse. Although only
fifty years of age, she had long been in failing health,
and only awaited the Emperor's coming to lay down her
arduous office and retire to a convent at Bruges. An
unforeseen accident hastened her end. She hurt her
foot by treading on the broken pieces of a crystal
goblet, blood-poisoning came on, and she died in her
sleep on the 30th of November, without ever seeing
her nephew again. The touching letter in which she
bade him farewell was written a few hours before her
death:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"The hour has come when I can no longer
write with my own hand, for I am so dangerously ill
that I fear my remaining hours will be few. But my
conscience is tranquil, and I am ready to accept God's
will, and have no regrets saving that I am deprived
of your presence, and am unable to see you and speak
with you before I die.... I leave you your provinces,
greatly increased in extent since your departure, and
resign the government, which I trust I have discharged
in such a way as to merit a Divine reward,
and earn the good-will of your subjects as well as
your approval. And above all, Monseigneur, I recommend
you to live at peace, more especially with
the Kings of France and England. Finally I beg
of you, by the love which you have been pleased to
bear me, remember the salvation of my soul and my
recommendations on behalf of my poor servants.
And so I bid you once more farewell, praying, Monseigneur,
that you may enjoy a long life and great
prosperity.</p>

<p>
"From Malines the last day of November, 1530."<br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This letter reached the Emperor at Cologne together
with the news of Margaret's death, and a solemn
requiem was chanted for her soul in the cathedral.
Charles and his subjects fully realized the great loss
which his <i>pays de par-de&ccedil;a</i> had suffered by his aunt's
death.</p>

<p>"All the provinces," said Cornelius Agrippa, in the
funeral oration which he pronounced in S. Rombaut
of Malines, "all the cities, and all the villages,
are plunged in tears and sorrow. For no greater
loss could have befallen us and our country."</p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] MARY OF HUNGARY</div>

<p>The young Prince of Denmark, whom Margaret
had loved so well, was chief mourner on this occasion,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>and rode at the head of the procession which bore
her remains to Bruges. Here they were laid in the
Convent of the Annunciation until the magnificent
shrine that she had begun at Brou in Savoy was ready
to receive her ashes and those of her husband. When,
in the following March, the Emperor came to Malines,
Prince John welcomed him in a Latin speech, in which
he made a pathetic allusion to the loss which he and
his sisters had sustained in the death of one who
had been to them the wisest and tenderest of mothers.
Then, turning to his uncle with charming grace, he
begged the Emperor to have compassion upon him
and his orphaned sisters, and allow them to remain at
his Court until their father should be restored to his
rightful throne. The young Prince's simple eloquence
produced a deep impression. The Emperor with
tears in his eyes embraced him, and the magistrates
of Malines presented him with a barrel of Rhenish
wine in token of their regard.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately for the children of Denmark, as well
as for the provinces which Margaret had ruled so well,
another Habsburg Princess was found to take her
place. This was the Emperor's sister Mary, whose
gallant husband, King Louis of Hungary, had fallen
on the field of Mohacz four years before, fighting
against the Turks. The widowed Queen, although
only twenty-one, had shown admirable presence of
mind, and it was largely due to her tact and popularity
that her brother Ferdinand and his wife Anna,
the dead King's sister, were recognized as joint Sovereigns
of Bohemia and Hungary. Her own hand was
sought in marriage by many Princes, including the
young King James V. of Scotland and her sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Eleanor's old lover, the Palatine Frederic, whose
romantic imagination was deeply impressed by the
young Queen's heroic bearing. But Mary positively
refused to take another husband, saying that, having
found perfect happiness in her first marriage, she had
no wish to try a second. To the end of her life she
remained true to her dead lord, and never put off
her widow's weeds. But her courage and spirit were
as high as ever. She was passionately fond of hunting,
and amazed the hardest riders by being all day
in the saddle without showing any trace of fatigue.
Her powers of mind were no less remarkable. She
was the ablest of the whole family, and the wisdom
of her judgments was equalled by the frankness with
which she expressed them. Like all the Habsburg
ladies, she was highly educated, and spoke Latin as
well as any doctor in Louvain, according to Erasmus,
who inscribed her name on the first page of his
"Veuve Chr&eacute;tienne." Mary shared her sister Isabella's
sympathy with the reformers, and accepted the
dedication of Luther's "Commentary on the Four
Psalms of Consolation." When this excited her
brother Ferdinand's displeasure, she told him that
authors must do as they please in these matters,
and that he might trust her not to tarnish the fair
name of their house. "God," she added, "would
doubtless give her grace to die a good Christian."<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] THE NEW REGENT</div>

<p>In the spring of 1530 Mary met Charles at Innsbruck,
and accompanied him to Augsburg. When,
a few months later, the news of Margaret's death
reached him at Cologne, the Emperor begged her to
become Regent of the Low Countries and share the
burden of government with him. But Mary had no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>wish to enter public life, and asked her brother's leave
to retire to Spain and devote herself to the care of
their unhappy mother, Queen Juana. For some
time she resisted the entreaties of both her brothers,
and it was only a strong sense of duty which finally
overcame her reluctance to assume so arduous and
ungrateful a task. When at length she consented,
she made it a condition that she should not be troubled
with offers of marriage, and pointed out that her
Lutheran sympathies might well arouse suspicion in
the Netherlands. But Charles brushed these objections
lightly aside, saying that no one should disturb her
peace, and that he should never have trusted her with
so important a post if he had regarded her Lutheran
tendencies seriously. All he asked was that the
Queen should not bring her German servants to the
Low Countries, lest they should arouse the jealousy
of his Flemish courtiers.</p>

<p>Mary scrupulously fulfilled these conditions, and on
the 23rd of January, 1531, the new Regent entered
Louvain in state, and was presented to the Council
by the Emperor, as Governess of the Netherlands.
Two months later she accompanied Charles to Malines,
where for the first time she embraced her little
nieces. For the present, however, Dorothea and
Christina, who were only nine and ten years old,
remained at Malines, while Prince John accompanied
his uncle and aunt on a progress through the
provinces.</p>

<p>Mary soon realized all the difficulties of the task
that she had undertaken with so much reluctance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Emperor," she wrote to Ferdinand from
Brussels, "has fastened the rope round my neck, but
I find public affairs in a great tangle, and if His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
Majesty does not reduce them to some degree of
order before his departure, I shall find myself in a very
tight place."<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p></div>

<p>The Treasury was exhausted, the people groaned
under the load of taxation, and the prodigal generosity
of the late Regent had not succeeded in suppressing
strife and jealousy among the nobles. As Mary
wrote many years afterwards to her nephew, Philip II.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"No doubt our aunt, Madame Marguerite, ruled the
Netherlands long and well; but when she grew old and
ailing she was obliged to leave the task to others,
and when the Emperor returned there after her death,
he found the nobles at variance, justice little respected,
and all classes disaffected to the imperial service."<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] A FORLORN HOPE</div>

<p>But the young Regent brought all her spirit and
energy to the task, and with her brother's help succeeded
in reforming the gravest abuses and restoring
some order into the finances. The gravest difficulty
with which she had to contend was the presence of
the King of Denmark. Since Margaret's death this
monarch had grown bolder and more insolent in his
demands. With the help of his old ally, Duke Henry
of Brunswick, he collected 6,000 men-at-arms and
invaded Holland, spreading fire and sword wherever
he went. In vain Charles remonstrated with him
on the suffering which he inflicted on peaceable citizens.
Christian only replied with an insolent letter,
which convinced the Emperor more than ever of "the
man's little sense and honesty." He now feared that
the King would seize one of the forts in Holland and
remain there all the winter, feeding his soldiers at the
expense of the unfortunate peasantry, and infecting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>them with Lutheran heresy. Under these circumstances
Charles felt that it was impossible to desert his
sister, and decided to put off his departure for Germany
until he had got rid of this troublesome guest.</p>

<p>At length, on the 26th of October, Christian sailed
from Medemblik, in North Holland, with twenty-five
ships and 7,000 men.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He has done infinite damage to my provinces of
Holland and Utrecht," wrote Charles to Ferdinand,
"treating them as if they were enemies, and forcing
them to provide him with boats and provisions,
besides seizing the supplies which I had collected for
my own journey."<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p></div>

<p>So great were the straits to which Charles found
himself reduced that he was compelled to raise a fresh
loan in order to defray the expenses of his journey
to Spires. But at least the hated adventurer was
gone, and as a fair wind sprang up, and the sails of
King Christian's fleet dropped below the horizon, the
Emperor and his subjects felt that they could breathe
freely.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The King of Dacia," wrote the Italian traveller
Mario Savorgnano, from Brussels, on the 6th of
November, "has sailed with twenty big ships, thus
relieving this land from a heavy burden. He goes
to recover his kingdom of Denmark, a land lying
north of the Cymbric Chersonesus.... But I am
sure that when the people come face to face with
these mercenaries, especially those who have been
in Italy and have there learnt to rob, sack, burn, and
leave no cruelty undone, in their greed for gold, they
will rise and drive out the invaders."<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p></div>

<p>This time Christian determined not to attempt a
landing in Denmark, but to sail straight to Norway,
where he had always been more popular than in any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>other part of his dominions, and still numbered many
partisans. His expectations were not disappointed.
When he landed, on the 5th of November, the
peasantry and burghers flocked to his standard.
The Archbishop of Drondtheim and the clergy declared
in his favour, and the States-General, which met in
January, 1532, at Oslo, the old capital, renewed their
oaths of allegiance to him as their rightful King.
But the strong forts of Bergen and Aggershus, at the
gates of the town, closed their gates against him, and
his army soon began to dwindle away for want of
supplies. Early in the spring a strong fleet, fitted
out by King Frederic, with the help of the citizens
of L&uuml;beck, appeared before Oslo, and set fire to Christian's
ships in the harbour, while a Danish army, under
Knut Gyldenstern, advanced from the south. Once
more the King's nerve failed him. He met the
Danish captain in a meadow outside Oslo, and, after
prolonged negotiations, agreed to lay down his arms
and go to Copenhagen, to confer with his uncle.
The next day he disbanded his forces and took leave
of his loyal supporters. Thus, without striking a
blow, he delivered Norway into the usurper's hands,
and surrendered his last claim to the three kingdoms.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] CHRISTIAN II.'S FALL</div>

<p>In return for his submission, Gyldenstern had
promised the King honourable entertainment and
given him a written safe-conduct. Trusting in these
assurances, Christian went on board a Danish ship,
and on the 24th of July arrived before Copenhagen.
As the ship sailed up the Sound in the early summer
morning, people flocked from all parts to see their
old King, and many of the women and children wept
aloud. His fate, they realized, was already sealed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Before the arrival of the fleet, a conference had been
held between Frederic and the Swedish and Hanse
deputies, who agreed that so dangerous a foe must
not be allowed to remain at liberty, and condemned
the unfortunate monarch to perpetual imprisonment
in the island fortress of Sonderburg. In vain Christian
demanded to be set on shore and conducted into
his uncle's presence. He was told that the King
would meet him in the Castle of Flensburg in Schleswig.
But when, instead of sailing in this direction, the ship
which bore him entered the narrow Alsener Sound,
and the walls of Sonderburg came in sight, the unhappy
King saw the trap into which he had fallen,
and broke into transports of rage. But it was too
late, and he was powerless in the hands of his enemies.
No indignity was spared him by his captors. As he
entered the lonely cell in the highest turret of the
castle, Knut Gyldenstern, who is said to have been
one of his mistress Dyveke's lovers, plucked the
fallen monarch by the beard, and tore the jewel of
the Golden Fleece from his neck. None of the old
servants who had clung to their exiled Prince so
faithfully were allowed to share his prison, and
for many years a pet dwarf was his sole companion.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>In this foul and treacherous manner King Christian
II. was betrayed into the hands of his foes and
doomed to lifelong captivity. And, by a strange fate,
in these early days of August, at the very moment
when the iron gates of Sonderburg closed behind him,
his only son, the rightful heir to the three kingdoms,
died far away in Southern Germany, within the walls
of the imperial city of Regensburg.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>
<p>Meanwhile the news of Christian's unexpected
success in Norway had reached Brussels and excited
great surprise.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The King of Denmark," wrote Mary of Hungary
to her brother Ferdinand, "has done so well
by his rashness that he has actually recovered possession
of one of his kingdoms, and his friends hope
that he may be able to stay there."<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote">1523-31] COURT F&Ecirc;TES</div>

<p>This was towards the end of December, when the
imperial family had assembled in the palace to keep
Christmas. Prince John had won golden opinions
on the progress which he had made with his uncle
and aunt, and was as much beloved by the Emperor,
wrote Mario Savorgnano, as if he were his own son.
Now his little sisters were brought to Brussels by
their uncle's command to share in the festivities.
Early in January, 1532, Charles heard that his sister,
Queen Katherine of Portugal, had given birth to a
son, and the happy event was celebrated by a grand
tournament on the square in front of the Portuguese
Ambassador's house. The Emperor, accompanied by
the Queen of Hungary and the Prince and Princesses
of Denmark, looked on at the jousts and sword and
torch dances from a balcony draped with white and
green velvet, and at nine o'clock sat down to a
sumptuous banquet. The Queen was seated at the
head of the table, opposite the fireplace, with the
Emperor on her right and Princess Dorothea at his
side. Prince John was on his aunt's left, and the
youthful Christina, who made her first appearance in
public on this occasion, sat between her brother and
the Portuguese Ambassador. Henry of Nassau, the
Prince of Bisignano, and Ferrante Gonzaga, were at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>the same board, while Nassau's son, the young Prince
Ren&eacute;, who had lately inherited the principality of
Orange from his maternal uncle, sat with the Queen's
ladies at another table. Charles was in high spirits.
He talked and laughed with all the lords and ladies
who were present during the interminable number of
courses of meat, fish, game, wines, cakes, and fruits,
that were served in succession, with brief interludes
of music. When, at eleven, the Emperor rose from
table, an Italian comedy was acted, in which Ferrante
Gonzaga and several Italian and Spanish noblemen
took part. Then King Cupid appeared, riding in a
triumphal car, and a troop of Loves danced hand in
hand, until, at a sign from Charles, the actors removed
their masks. A collation of confetti and Madeira and
Valencia wines was then served at a buffet laden with
costly gold and silver cups and precious bowls of
Oriental porcelain. When all the guests had ate and
drunk their fill, the finest crystal vases and bottles
of perfume were presented to the Queen and Princesses,
and the other ladies received gifts from the
Ambassador. The royal guests joined with great spirit
in the dancing which followed, and did not retire
till two o'clock.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Concerts and suppers, jousts and
dances, succeeded each other throughout the week,
and the Emperor gave splendid presents to the
Ambassador of Portugal, and sent cordial congratulations
to his royal brother-in-law on the birth of his
son and heir.</p>

<p>A fortnight later Charles left Brussels, taking
Prince John with him, and travelled by slow stages
to Regensburg, where the Imperial Diet was opened
in May. Here the Court remained during the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
three months, and the young Prince was sent to
receive the Count Palatine, the Archbishop of Mainz,
and other Princes of the Empire, who arrived in turn
to take part in the assembly. Unluckily the weather
proved very disagreeable. "Never," exclaimed the
Venetian Ambassador, "was there such a detestable
climate!" A long continuance of heavy rains and
unusual heat was followed by some bitterly cold
days, which produced serious illness. Princes and
nobles, Ambassadors and servants, all succumbed in
turn to the same epidemic. The Venetian took to
his bed, and four of his servants became seriously ill.
The Emperor himself was invalided, and left the
town to take waters and change of air in a neighbouring
village. "There is hardly a house in the Court,"
wrote the Mantuan Envoy, "where some person is not
ill. Most people recover, but a good many die,
especially those who are young." Among the victims
was Prince John of Denmark. Charles returned to
find his nephew in high fever and delirium. He was
deeply distressed, and when the poor boy became
unconscious, and the doctors gave no hope, he left
the town again, saying that he could not bear to see
the child die. The Prince never recovered consciousness,
and passed away at two o'clock on the morning
of the 12th of August.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The poor little Prince of Denmark died last
night," wrote the Mantuan Ambassador, "to the
infinite distress of the whole Court, and above all of
C&aelig;sar, who bore him singular affection, not only on
account of the close ties of blood between them, but
because of the young Prince's charming nature and
winning manners, which made him beloved by everyone
and gave rise to the highest hopes."<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p></div>

<p>By the Emperor's orders an imposing funeral
service was held at Regensburg, after which the
Prince's body was taken to Ghent and buried in his
mother's grave. Charles himself wrote to break the
sad news to Mary of Hungary and her poor little nieces:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Madame my good Sister</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"This is only to inform you of the loss we
have suffered in the death of our little nephew of
Denmark, whom it pleased God to take to Himself
on Sunday morning, the day before yesterday, after
he had been ill of internal catarrh for a whole week.
This has caused me the greatest grief that I have
ever known. For he was the dearest little fellow, of
his age, that it was possible to see, and I have felt
this loss more than I did that of my son, for he was
older, and I knew him better and loved him as if he
had been my own child. But we must bow to the
Divine will. Although I know that God might have
allowed this to happen anywhere, I cannot help feeling
that if I had left the boy at home with you he might
not have died. At least his father will be sure to
say so. I expect you know where he is said to be.
Without offence to God, I could wish he were in his
son's place, and his son well received in his own
kingdom. All the same, without pretending to be
the judge, perhaps the King has not deserved to be
there, and the little rogue is better off where he is
than where I should have liked to see him, and smiles
at my wish for him, for he was certainly not guilty of
any great sins. He died in so Christian a manner
that, if he had committed as many as I have, there
would have been good hope of his soul's weal, and
with his last breath he called on Jesus. I am writing
to my little nieces, as you see, to comfort them. I
am sure that you will try and do the same. The
best remedy will be to find them two husbands."<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p></div>

<p>When Charles wrote these touching words, he had
not yet heard of the disastrous end to King Christian's
campaign, and believed the Prince's father to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
possession of the Norwegian capital. But he added
a postscript to his letter, telling the Queen of a report
which had just arrived, that the King had been taken
prisoner by his foes. Four days later this report
was confirmed by letters from L&uuml;beck merchants,
and no further doubt could be entertained of the
doom which had overtaken the unhappy monarch.
His melancholy fate excited little compassion, either
in Germany or in the Netherlands. Luther, to his
credit, addressed an earnest appeal to King Frederic
congratulating him on his victory, and begging him
to take example by Christ, who died for His murderers,
and have pity on the unfortunate captive. But in
reply Frederic issued an apology, in which he brought
the gravest charges against the deposed King, and
accused him of having preferred a low woman of
worthless character to the noblest and most virtuous
of Queens. Before long the old commercial treaties
between Denmark and the Low Countries were
renewed, and the Baltic trade was resumed on the
understanding that no attempt was made to revive
King Christian's claims.</p>

<p>The prisoner of Sonderburg was forgotten by the
world, and the one being who loved him best on earth,
his sister Elizabeth of Brandenburg, could only commend
his little daughters sadly to the Regent, and
beg her to have compassion on these desolate children.
Mary replied in a letter full of feeling, assuring
Elizabeth that she need have no fear on this score,
and that her little nieces should be treated as if they
were her own daughters. She kept her word nobly.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

as "A table with the pictures of the three children of the King of
Denmark, with a curtain of white and yellow sarcenet." In
Charles I.'s inventory it is described as "A Whitehall piece,
curiously painted by Mabusius, wherein two men children and
one woman child are playing with some oranges in their hands
by a green table, little half-figures upon a board in a wooden
frame." At the sale of the King's effects it was called a Mabuse,
and valued at &pound;10. In 1743 the same picture hung in Queen
Caroline's closet at Kensington Palace, and was described by
Vertue as "Prince Arthur and his sisters, children of Henry VII."
Five years later it was removed to Windsor and engraved under
this name. Sir George Scharf was the first to correct this obvious
error and restore the original title (see "Arch&aelig;ologia," xxxix. 245).
Old copies of the picture, mostly dating from the seventeenth
century, are to be seen at Wilton, Longford, Corsham, and other
places.</p></div>

<h2>BOOK IV<br />

CHRISTINA, DUCHESS OF MILAN<br />

1533-1535</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>In the letter which the Emperor wrote to Mary of
Hungary on his nephew's death, he remarked that
the best way of consoling his little nieces for their
brother's loss would be to find them husbands. The
marriages of these youthful Princesses had already
engaged his attention for some time past. While
Christina was still a babe in her nurse's arms, the
Regent Margaret had been planning marriages for
her great-nieces. In 1527 Wolsey proposed King
Henry's illegitimate son, the Duke of Richmond, as
an eligible suitor for one of them, but the idea of
such a union was scouted by the imperial family.<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
A marriage between Dorothea and her second cousin,
King James V. of Scotland, was discussed during many
years, and only abandoned eventually owing to the
fickle character of the young monarch. After Prince
John's death, this Princess inherited her brother's
claims to the Danish throne, and King Frederic went
so far as to propose that she should wed his younger
son John, offering to recognize him as heir to Denmark,
and leave the duchies of Schleswig-Holstein to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>elder son Christian. But the Emperor and Mary of
Hungary were both reluctant to treat with the
usurper who had deposed their brother-in-law, and
the death of Frederic in April, 1533, put an end to
the scheme.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1533-35] FRANCESCO SFORZA</div>

<p>Another suitor now came forward in the person of
Francesco Sforza, Duke of Milan. This Prince was
the younger brother of Massimiliano Sforza, who as
a boy had spent several years at the Court of Malines,
and had been deposed by Francis I. after a brief reign
of three years. Born at Milan on the 4th of February,
1495, when his father, Lodovico, was at the height of
his glory, and named after his grandfather, the great
Condottiere, Francesco II. had been the sport of
Fortune from his childhood. Before he was two
years old, his mother, the brilliant Duchess Beatrice,
died, and when he was five his father lost both
throne and freedom. While the unfortunate Moro
ended his days in the dungeons of Loches, his young
children were brought up in Germany by their cousin
Bianca, the second wife of the Emperor Maximilian.
Francesco spent most of his time at Innsbruck, and,
after the brief interlude of his brother's reign at
Milan, retired once more to Trent. His opportunity
came in 1521, when Leo X., in his dread of France,
joined with Charles V. to place the younger Sforza
on his father's throne. A gallant soldier and cultivated
man, Francesco II. won the hearts of all his
subjects, who rejoiced to see a Sforza Duke again
among them. But misfortune dogged his footsteps.
In 1523 Milan was once more taken by the French,
and after their defeat at Pavia the Duke incurred
the Emperor's displeasure, and was deprived of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>State, chiefly owing to the intrigues of his Chancellor,
Morone, with Pope Clement VII. It was only in
December, 1529, when Charles came to Bologna for
his coronation, that, at the intercession of the Pope
and the Venetians, he consented to pardon Francesco,
and give him the investiture of Milan for the enormous
sum of 900,000 ducats. But it was a barren realm
to which the Duke returned. His subjects were
ruined by years of warfare, his own health had
suffered severely from the hardships which he had
undergone, and he had been dangerously wounded by
the poisoned dagger of an assassin. At thirty-eight
he was a broken man, prematurely old and grey.
The Venetian chronicler Marino Sanuto, who saw the
Duke at Venice in October, 1530, describes him as
looking very melancholy, and being only able to walk
and move his hands with difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> He applied himself,
however, manfully to the almost hopeless task of
relieving the distress of his subjects and restoring
order and prosperity. With great difficulty he
succeeded in raising 400,000 ducats, the first installment
of the payment for the investiture of Milan,
upon which the Castello was restored to him. His
loyalty and modesty had gone far to recover the
Emperor's confidence, and Charles treated him with
marked favour and kindness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1533-35] THE DUKE'S COURTSHIP</div>

<p>This encouraged Francesco to aspire to the hand
of a Princess of the imperial house. His subjects
were exceedingly anxious to see their Duke married,
and already more than one suitable bride had been
proposed. But Margherita Paleologa, the heiress of
Montferrat, whom her mother would gladly have
given Francesco in marriage, was wedded to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>cousin Federico, Duke of Mantua, in October, 1531,
and the Pope's niece, the Duchessina Caterina de'
Medici, another prize who had been dangled before
the Duke of Milan's eyes, was betrothed to the Duke
of Orleans in the following year. Before this event
was announced, in January, 1532, the Milanese
Ambassador, Camillo Ghilino, who had accompanied
Charles to Brussels, ventured to ask the Emperor,
on his master's behalf, for the hand of one of his
nieces. Charles was evidently not averse to the
proposal. It was part of his policy to consolidate
the different Italian dynasties, and he was alive to
the advantage of drawing the Duke of Milan into
his family circle. But he returned an evasive answer,
saying that Princess Dorothea was already destined
for the King of Scotland, while her sister Christina
was too young, and that he could arrange nothing
without the consent of her father, the King of Denmark,
who had gone to Norway to try and recover
his kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> When Francesco met Charles at
Bologna in the following December, and was admitted
to the newly-formed League of Italian States, he renewed
his suit, and once more asked for Christina's
hand. On the 10th of March Charles came to Milan,
and spent four days in the Castello, after which he
accompanied the Duke on a hunting-party at Vigevano,
and enjoyed excellent sport, killing two wild-boars
and three stags with his own hand.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> During this
visit the marriage was arranged, and on the 10th of
June, 1533, the contract was signed at Barcelona
by the Emperor on the one hand, and the Chancellor
of Milan, Count Taverna, and the ducal Chamberlain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>Count Tommaso Gallerati, on the other. Christina
was to receive 100,000 ducats out of the sum due to
the Emperor, as her dowry, and in the event of
Dorothea succeeding to the throne of Denmark
another 100,000 was to be settled on her. Hawkins,
the English Ambassador, who wrote home from
Barcelona to announce the conclusion of the marriage,
remarked that the Milanese had left well pleased,
but that the Duke was somewhat to be pitied, since
he was only to have the younger sister, and no fortune
with her. "Dower getteth he none."<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>In spite of this drawback, the Milanese received
the news with great rejoicing, and any regret which
they might have felt at the substitution of the younger
for the elder sister was dispelled by the Spaniards
in the Emperor's suite, who informed the Duke's
Ambassadors that Christina was taller and far more
beautiful than Dorothea. Francesco himself wrote
to an old friend in Cremona, Giorgio Guazzo, saying
that he would lose no time in telling him of his great
good fortune in winning so high-born and attractive
a young lady for his bride.<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> At the same time he
agreed with the Emperor to send Count Massimiliano
Stampa, his intimate friend, to the Netherlands, to
wed the Princess in his name, and bring her to Milan
that autumn. Meanwhile the news of the marriage
was received with much less satisfaction in the Low
Countries. Mary had taken the motherless children
to her heart, and was especially attached to Christina,
who resembled her in character and tastes. She inherited
the family passion for riding and hunting, and
combined her aunt's intelligence and ability with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>her mother's sweetness of disposition. The idea of
marrying this charming child of eleven to a half-paralyzed
invalid old enough to be her father was
repulsive, and Mary did not hesitate to protest against
the Emperor's decision with characteristic frankness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1533-35] MARY'S PROTEST</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>," she wrote to Charles on the 25th of
August, "I have received Your Majesty's letters with
the copy of the treaty which you have been pleased
to make between our niece, Madame Chr&eacute;tienne, and
the Duke of Milan, on which point I must once for all
relieve my conscience. I will at least show you the
difficulties which to my mind lie in the way, so that
Your Majesty may consider if any remedy can be
devised before the matter is finally arranged. As for
our said niece, I have no doubt that she will agree
to whatever you please to wish, since she regards you
as her lord and father, in whom she places absolute
trust, and is ready to obey you as your very humble
daughter and slave. The child is so good and willing
there will be no need for any persuasion on my part,
either as regards the Count's coming or anything else
that you may please to command; but on the other
hand, Monseigneur, since the words of the treaty
clearly show that the marriage is to be consummated
immediately, and she will have to take her departure
without delay, I must point out that she is not yet
old enough for this, being only eleven years and a
half, and I hold that it would be contrary to the
laws of God and reason to marry her at so tender an
age. She is still quite a child, and, whatever may
be the custom in yonder country, you are exposing
her to the risk of bearing a child at this tender age,
and of losing both her own life and that of her issue.
Monseigneur, I am saying more than I ought to say,
and speaking with a freedom which I can only beg
you to forgive, because both my conscience and the
love which I bear the child constrain me to write
thus. On the other hand, seeing that this treaty
requires the two sisters to make certain promises,
I do not think that she is old enough to enter into
these engagements, while her sister, although turned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>twelve, is very young of her age, and should hardly
make these promises without the consent of her
father, who is still living. I know that I am meddling
with other people's business by writing to you of
those matters which are not, strictly speaking, my
affair. But I feel that I must send you these warnings,
not from any wish to prevent the marriage, if Your
Majesty thinks it well, but in order to give you a
reason for breaking it off, if any difficulties should
arise. For it seems to me, that as people often try
to discover the fifth wheel in the coach, where there
is no reason to make any difficulty, it would be easy
to find some excuse for embroiling matters, when so
good a cause exists. I quite understand that it may
not be easy to alter the treaty at this hour, but, since
I had not the opportunity of speaking to you on
the subject before, I feel it to be my duty to warn
you of these things, and to remind you of the child's
tender age, of which Your Majesty may not have
been aware. However this may be, Monseigneur, I
have written this to fulfil my duty to God, as well as
to Your Majesty, my niece, and the whole world,
and can only beg you not to take what I have said
in bad part, or to believe that any other cause could
have led me to speak so plainly; and I take my Creator
to witness that this is true, begging Him to give you
health and long life, and grant your good and virtuous
desires:</p>

<p>Charles answered the Queen's protest in the following
brief letter, which showed that his mind was
made up, and that he would allow no change in his
plans:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

<p>"I have received your letter, and will only
reply briefly, as I am writing to you at length on other
matters by my secretary, and also because my niece's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>affair is rather a matter for priests and lawyers
than for me, and I have desired Granvelle to satisfy
your objections. So I will only tell you that, as
the children's father is more dead to them than if
he had ceased to live, I signed the marriage treaty
before I left Barcelona. As for the question of issue,
I fear that the Duke's advanced years will prove a
greater barrier than my niece's tender youth. I
am sure that you will act in accordance with my
wishes, and I beg you to do this once more.</p>

<p>There was clearly nothing more to be said; but
Mary had secretly determined, whatever happened,
not to allow the actual marriage to take place until
the following year, and in the end she had her way.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">1533-35] STAMPA'S MISSION</div>

<p>When the Emperor wrote this letter to his sister,
Count Massimiliano had already started on his journey.
He left Milan on the eve of St. Bartholomew,
taking Count Francesco Sfondrati of Cremona and
Pier Francesco Bottigella of Pavia with him, and
travelled by Trent and Spires to Louvain, where he
arrived on the 12th of September. The next day
he was conducted to Ghent by Monsieur de Courri&egrave;res,
the Captain of the Archers' Guard, and met at the
palace gates by Monsieur de Molembais, the Queen's
Grand Falconer, who informed him that Her Majesty
was laid up, owing to a slight accident out hunting,
and could not receive him at present. After many
delays, Stampa at length succeeded in obtaining an
audience, and begged the Queen earnestly to satisfy
his master's impatience, and allow the marriage to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>be concluded without delay. Mary replied very civilly
that, since this was C&aelig;sar's will, she would certainly
put no obstacle in the way, but explained that affairs
of State compelled her to visit certain frontier towns,
and begged the Count to await her return to Brussels.
She then sent for the Princesses, and Stampa was
presented and allowed to kiss their hands. But, as he
only saw them for five minutes, all he could tell his
master was that Christina seemed very bright and
lively, and was much better-looking than her sister.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a></p>

<p>In spite of the courtesy with which he was entertained
by De Courri&egrave;res and the Duke of Aerschot,
Stampa clearly saw that it was Mary's intention to
delay the marriage as long as possible, and began to
despair of ever attaining his object. Fortunately,
by the end of the week the Emperor's confidential
Chamberlain, Louis de Praet, arrived at Ghent.
De Praet had been Ambassador in England and
France, and was now sent from Spain to represent
His Majesty at the wedding and escort the bride to
Milan. When he had seen Stampa's copy of the
Treaty of Barcelona, he advised him to join the Queen
at Lille and deliver his credentials. Here the Count
accordingly presented himself on the 18th of September,
and was graciously received by Mary, who
assured him that the affair which lay so near his
heart would shortly be arranged. He was conducted
into a room where he found the Princesses
and their governess, Madame de Fiennes, and conversed
with them for half an hour. When the Queen
rose to attend vespers, she touched the Count's sleeve
and made him walk at her side as far as the chapel,
and thanked him for the fine horse which the Duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
had sent her, telling him how fond she was of hunting.
The next day Stampa was invited to supper, and
afterwards ventured to ask if he might see the
Princesses dance. To this request the Queen gave
her consent. The flutes and tambourines struck up
a merry tune, and the Princesses danced first a <i>ballo
al francese</i>, then a <i>branle</i>, and a variety of French
and German dances, in which the gentlemen and
ladies-in-waiting took part. The Count was about
to take his leave, since the hour was already late,
when De Praet told him he must first see the Princesses
dance a <i>ballo all'italiano</i>, upon which the two sisters
rose and, joining hands, danced an Italian ballet
with charming grace. The Ambassador was delighted,
and wrote to tell his master what a favourable impression
Christina had made upon him and his
companions:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"She is hardly shorter than her sister, and much
handsomer and more graceful, and is indeed as well
built and attractive a maiden as you could wish to
see. God grant this may lead to a happy marriage!"<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p></div>

<p>The next morning business began in good earnest.
Prolonged negotiations were held between Stampa
and the Queen's Councillors&mdash;Aerschot, De Praet,
and other nobles&mdash;and the rights of the Princess
Dorothea and the condition of Denmark were fully
discussed. While the Count was at dinner, De Praet
came in, and, to his surprise, informed him that Her
Majesty wished the wedding to be celebrated on the
following Sunday, the 28th of September. The Count
asked nothing better, and hastened to send the good
news to Milan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1533-35] CHRISTINA'S WEDDING</div>

<p>On Saturday evening Christina signed the marriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>contract before an illustrious assembly in a hall of
the palace at Lille, which was hung with black and
gold damask for the occasion, and between four and
five on Sunday afternoon the wedding was solemnized
by the Bishop of Tournay in the chapel. Count
Massimiliano, gallantly arrayed in cloth of gold, was
conducted to the altar by De Praet and the great
officers of State; the violins and drums sounded, and
the bridal procession entered, the Queen leading her
niece by the hand. "As the Bishop placed the
nuptial ring on the bride's finger," wrote Stampa to
his lord, "she received it with evident pleasure, and
all the Court displayed great satisfaction."</p>

<p>When the ceremony was over, the bride retired, and
Stampa spent some time in conversation with the
Queen, vainly endeavouring to persuade her to fix
a date for the Duchess's journey. But on this point
Mary was inflexible. De Praet, who visited him the
next day, explained that the Queen could not allow
this youthful lady to be exposed to the perils and
fatigue of so long a journey in winter, and that her
departure must therefore be put off till the following
spring. This was a grievous disappointment to the
Count, who knew how anxious the Duke was to see
his wife. But he had to accept the situation, and
could only try and console his master by repeating
the Queen's assurances of good-will and affection.</p>

<p>She even begged the Count to join her in a hunting
expedition at Brussels in the following week. But
this Stampa firmly declined, saying that he must
return to Milan without delay. On the same evening
he had the honour of a parting interview with the
Duchess, and presented her with a fine diamond
and ruby ring and a length of costly brocade in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
lord's name. Christina's eyes sparkled with delight
at the sight of these gifts, and she thanked Count
Massimiliano with a warmth which captivated him.
Then he took leave of the Queen, who started at
break of day in torrents of rain, to hunt on her way
to Brussels, leaving the Princesses to return by
Tournay. The Count himself went to Antwerp to
raise money for his journey, and despatched a
messenger to Milan with full accounts of the wedding.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"All this Court and the Queen herself," he wrote,
"are delighted with this happy event. And Your
Excellency may rejoice with good reason, and may
rest assured that you have the fairest, most charming
and gallant bride that any man could desire."<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p></div>

<p>These despatches reached Milan on the 13th of
October, and were received with acclamation. Guns
were fired from the Castello, the bells of all the churches
were rung, and the Senate went in solemn procession
to give thanks to God in the Duomo. "It was
indeed good tidings of great joy," wrote the chronicler
Burigozzo, "and such rejoicing had not been known
in Milan for many years."<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Francesco's own satisfaction
was considerably diminished by hearing that
his bride was not to set out on her journey until the
following February. But he took the Queen's decision
in good part, and wrote to express his eternal gratitude
to her and C&aelig;sar for giving him their niece.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"However anxious I naturally am to have my
wife with me," he added, "I recognize the gravity
of the reasons which have made you put off her
journey to a more convenient season, and think, as
you say, this should take place next February."<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">1533-35] THE DUKE'S APPEAL</div>

<p>The Duke sent this letter by a special messenger,
and received in reply the following brief note in
Italian from Christina:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Most illustrious Consort</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"It gave me great pleasure to hear of Your
Excellency's good health from Messer Sasso, and I
can assure you that my wish to join you is no less
ardent than your own. But it is only reasonable that
we should bow to the decision of the Most Serene
Queen, who orders everything wisely and well. I
will only add how sincerely I hope that you will keep
well, and love me as much as I love you.</p>

<p class="right">
"Your Excellency's most loving consort,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Christierna, Duchess of Milan</span>.<br />

<p>"From Brussels, November 4, 1533."<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p></div>

<p>On the last day of January, 1534, the Duke held
a Council of State to consider the best means of
raising the &pound;100,000 due to C&aelig;sar, which was
assigned to his niece for dower, and the citizens
agreed cheerfully to new taxes on grain and wine
in order to provide the necessary amount. But it
was not until the 31st of March that Francesco was
able to issue a proclamation informing the Milanese
that his wife had started on her journey. The
Duchess, he told them, would be among them by the
end of April, and he could count on his loyal subjects
to receive her with due honour; but, knowing as he
did their poverty, he begged that the customary
wedding gift should be omitted. The Milanese responded
with enthusiasm to their Duke's appeal, and
prepared to give his bride a worthy reception. Their
example was followed by the citizens of Novara,
Vigevano, and the other towns along the route between
Savoy and Milan. The roads, which were said to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
the worst in the duchy, were mended, triumphal
arches were erected, and lodgings were prepared for
her reception. The following quaintly-worded memorandum
was drawn up by Councillor Pier Francesco
Bottigella, to whom these arrangements were entrusted:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"(1) Mend the roads and clean the streets through
which the Lady Duchess will pass, and hang the
walls with tapestries and carpets, the largest and
widest that you can find. (2) Paint her arms on all
the gates through which she passes. (3) Provide a
baldacchino to be carried over her head. (4) See
that lodgings are prepared for her at Novara, either
in the Bishop's palace or in the ducal hunting-lodge,
and let these be cleansed and decorated. (5) Prepare
rooms in the town for the Duchess's household.
(6) Let this also be done in the Castello Vecchio at
Vigevano. (7) Desire that no gifts of any kind
should be made to the Duchess at Novara, Vigevano,
or any other place."<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p></div>

<p>When these instructions had been duly carried out,
Bottigella, who had accompanied Stampa on his
mission to the Low Countries, and was already
acquainted with the chief members of the Duchess's
suite, set out for Chamb&eacute;ry by the Duke's orders, to
meet the bride on the frontiers of Savoy and escort
her across the Alps.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1534</span>] A WEDDING JOURNEY</div>

<p>Christina had now completed her twelfth year,
and Mary of Hungary could no longer invent any
excuse to delay her journey to Milan. The bridal
party finally set out on the 11th of March, conducted
by Monseigneur de Praet, the Emperor's representative,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>and Camillo Ghilino, the Duke's Ambassador,
with an escort of 130 horse. Madame de Souvastre,
one of Maximilian's illegitimate daughters, whose
husband had been one of the late Regent's confidential
servants, was appointed mistress of the
Duchess's household, which consisted of six maids
of honour, six waiting-women, four pages, and ten
gentlemen. Christina herself rode in a black velvet
litter, drawn by four horses and attended by six
footmen, and her ladies travelled in similar fashion,
followed by twenty mules and three waggons with
the baggage. Mary had taken care that the bride's
trousseau was worthy of a daughter of the imperial
house, and the chests were filled with sumptuous
robes of cloth of gold and silver, of silk, satin, and
velvet, costly furs, jewels and pearls, together with
furniture and plate for her table and chapel, and
liveries and trappings for her servants and horses.
The Duchess's own lackeys and all the gentlemen in
attendance wore coats and doublets of black velvet,
and the other servants, we learn from John Hackett,
the English Ambassador at Brussels, were clad in
suits of "medley grey," trimmed with velvet, all
"very well accounted."<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The imposing cort&egrave;ge
travelled by slow stages through the friendly duchy
of Lorraine and across the plains of the imperial
county of Burgundy, taking journeys of twelve or
fifteen miles a day, until, on the 12th of April, it
halted at Chamb&eacute;ry, the frontier town of Savoy.
The reigning Duke, Charles III., was the Emperor's
brother-in-law and stanch ally, and the travellers
were hospitably entertained in his ancestral castle on
the heights. Here Bottigella was introduced into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Christina's presence by his old friend Camillo Ghilino,
and found her on the way to attend Mass in the
castle chapel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duchess," wrote the Councillor to his lord,
"received me in the most friendly manner, and asked
eagerly after you, and was especially anxious to
know where you were now. I told her that you were
at Vigevano, but would shortly return to Milan, to
prepare for her arrival. Mass was just beginning, so
I had to take my leave, but hope for another opportunity
of conversing with her before long, and can
see how eager she is to ask a hundred questions. She
is very well and lively, and does not seem any the
worse for the long journey. She has grown a great
deal since I saw her last September, and is as beautiful
as the sun. M. de Praet hopes to reach Turin in
seven days, and will start again to-morrow."<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1534</span>] BEATRIX OF SAVOY</div>

<p>The most arduous part of the journey now lay
before the travellers. Leaving Chamb&eacute;ry, they penetrated
into the heart of the Alps, through the narrow
gorge of the Is&egrave;re, between precipitous ravines with
castles crowning the rocks on either side, until they
reached the impregnable fortress of Montm&eacute;lian, the
ancient bulwark of Savoy, which had resisted all the
assaults of the French. After spending the night
here, they rode up the green pastures and pine-clad
slopes of S. Jean de Maurienne, and began the ascent
of the Mont Cenis, over "those troublesome and
horrid ways" of which English travellers complained
so bitterly, where loose stones and tumbled rocks
made riding almost impossible. "These ways, indeed,"
wrote Coryat, "are the worst I ever travelled
in my life, so much so that the roads of Savoy may
be proverbially spoken of as the owls of Athens, the
pears of Calabria, or the quails of Delos."<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> On the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>summit of the pass De Praet and his companions
saw with interest the Chapel of Our Lady of the
Snows, where a few years before the famous Constable
of Bourbon had offered up his sword on the altar of
the Virgin, as he led the imperial armies across the
Alps. Then they came down into a smiling green
valley, with walnut woods and rushing streams, and
saw the medieval towers of Susa at their feet. Here
they were met by the Emperor's Ambassador at the
Court of Savoy, who came to pay his respects to the
Duchess, bringing with him two elegant litters of
crimson brocade, sent by Charles's sister-in-law,
Beatrix of Portugal, Duchess of Savoy, for Christina's
use. At Rivoli, two stages farther on, fifty Councillors
from Turin, with the Bishop of Vercelli at their
head, appeared on horseback to escort the Duchess
to the city gates. Here Christina mounted her horse
and rode up the steep ascent to the citadel, with
De Praet walking at her side. The beautiful Duchess
Beatrix herself awaited her guest at the castle gates,
and, embracing Christina affectionately, led her by
the hand up the grand staircase into the best suite
of rooms in the palace. The travellers spent two
days in these comfortable quarters, and enjoyed the
brief interval of rest, although the Duchess, as Bottigella
was careful to tell the Duke, seemed the least
tired of the whole party, and was in blooming health
and high spirits.</p>

<p>On the following Sunday Christina rode into
Novara, on a brilliant spring morning, and was
lodged in the Bishop's palace, and received with the
greatest enthusiasm by her lord's subjects. At
Vigevano, the birthplace and favourite home of
Lodovico Sforza, the nobles, with Massimiliano Stampa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
at their head, rode out to welcome the Duke's bride,
and carried a rich baldacchino over her head. Nevertheless,
halfway between Novara and Vigevano, De
Praet complained to the Count that neither the reception
of the Duchess nor the rooms prepared for
her were sufficiently honourable&mdash;"in fact, he found
fault with everything." The Count expressed some
surprise, since both the Emperor Maximilian and
Charles V. himself had stayed at Vigevano, and the
latter had greatly admired the buildings and gardens
laid out by Bramante and Leonardo. But, to pacify
the exacting priest, Stampa proposed that the Duchess
should only take her <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> in the castle, and push
on to his own villa of Cussago, where she was to
spend some days before entering Milan. But De
Praet replied that the Duchess, not being yet accustomed
to this climate, felt the heat of the sun, and
must on no account ride any farther till evening.
So all the Count could do was to send Bottigella on
to see that the Castello was adorned with wreaths
of flowers and verdure, and that a good bed was
prepared for the Duchess.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1534</span>] CHRISTINA'S HUSBAND</div>

<p>At least, De Praet could find nothing to grumble
at in Stampa's country-house at Cussago, the ducal
palace and hunting-grounds which had been given
him by Francesco II. in reward for his unwavering
loyalty. The beauty of the spot, the delicious
gardens with their sunny lawns and sparkling fountains,
their rose and myrtle bowers, their bosquets
and running streams, enchanted the travellers from
the north. The villa had been adorned with frescoes
and marble doorways by the best Lombard masters
of the Moro's Court, and was once the favourite
country-house of Beatrice d'Este, the present Duke's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>mother, who often rode out from Milan to hunt in
the forests of the Brianza or play at ball on the
terraces. Now her son's child-bride saw these green
lawns in all the loveliness of early summer, and the
frescoed halls rang once more to the sound of mirth
and laughter. Music and dancing enlivened the days,
and a drama&mdash;<i>La Sposa Sagace</i>&mdash;was acted one evening
to amuse Christina. At nightfall the guns of the
Castello, firing salutes in her honour, were heard in the
distance, and the bonfires on the towers of Milan lit up
the evening sky with crimson glow. Count Massimiliano
took care that nothing should be lacking to
the enjoyment of the Duchess, and begged De Praet
to attend to her comfort in every particular, but, as
he told the Duke, it was not always easy to satisfy
these gentlemen.</p>

<p>One day Christina and her ladies received a visit
from the great Captain Antonio de Leyva, the Duke's
old enemy, who now came, cap in hand, to pay
homage to the Emperor's niece. Another day there
was a still greater stir at the villa, for the Duke
himself appeared unexpectedly, having ridden out
almost alone, to pay a surprise visit to his bride.
The first sight of her future lord must have given
Christina a shock, and her ladies whispered to each
other that this wan, grey-haired man, who could not
walk without the help of a stick, was hardly a fit
match for their fair young Princess. But Francesco's
chivalrous courtesy and gentleness went far to atone
for his physical defects, and nothing could exceed the
kindness which he showed his youthful bride. After
all, she was but a child, and the sight of this new
world that was laid at her feet with all its beauties
and treasures was enough to dazzle her eyes and
please her innocent fancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>On Sunday, the 3rd of May, the Duchess made her
state entry into Milan. Early in the afternoon she
rode in her litter to S. Eustorgio, the Dominican
convent outside the Ticino gate, where she was
received by the Duke's half-brother, Giovanni Paolo
Sforza, mounted on a superb charger, and attended
by all his kinsmen, clad in white and gold. After
paying her devotions at the marble shrine of S. Pietro
Martive, the Prior and friars conducted her to partake
of refreshments in the guests' hall, and receive the
homage of the Bishop and clergy, of the magistrates
and senators. At six o'clock, after vespers, the
procession started from the Porta Ticinese. First
came the armourers and their apprentices, in companies
of 200, with coloured flags in their hands
and plumes to match in their caps. One troop
was in blue, the other in green. At the head of the
first rode Alessandro Missaglia, a splendid figure,
wearing a silver helmet and shining armour over his
turquoise velvet vest, and mounted on a horse with
richly damascened harness. The green troop was
led by Girolamo Negriolo, the other famous Milanese
armourer. Then came 300 archers in pale blue silk,
and six bands of trumpeters and drummers, followed by
a great company of the noblest gentlemen of Milan, all
clad in white, with flowing plumes in their hats and
lances in their hands, riding horses draped with silver
brocade. Visconti, Trivulzio, Borromeo, Somaglia&mdash;all
the proudest names of Milan were there, and in the
rear rode the veteran Antonio de Leyva, with the
Emperor's representative, De Praet, at his side.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1534</span>] THE BRIDE'S ENTRY</div>

<p>Immediately behind them, under a white and gold
velvet baldacchino, borne by the doctors of the
University, rode the bride, mounted on a white horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
with glittering trappings, and wearing a rich white
brocade robe and a long veil over her flowing hair&mdash;"a
vision more divine than human," exclaims the
chronicler who witnessed the sight; "only," he adds
in an undertone, "she is still very young." At
the sight of the lovely child the multitude broke into
shouts of joy, and the clashing of bells, the blare of
trumpets, and sound of guns, welcomed the coming
of the Duchess. Close behind her rode Cardinal
Ercole Gonzaga, the Duke's cousin, and on either
side a guard of twelve noble youths, with white
ostrich feathers in their caps, so that Her Excellency
"appeared to be surrounded with a forest of waving
plumes." In the rear came Madame de Souvastre
and her ladies in litters, followed by a crowd of
senators, bishops, and magistrates.</p>

<p>Six triumphal arches, adorned with statues and
paintings, lined the route. Peace with her olive-branch,
Plenty with the cornucopia, Prosperity
bearing a caduceus, Joy crowned with flowers, welcomed
the bride in turn. Everywhere the imperial
eagles were seen together with the Sforza arms,
and countless mottoes with courtly allusions to the
golden age that had at length dawned for distracted
Milan. "Thy coming, O Christina, confirms the
peace of Italy!" On the piazza of the Duomo, a
pageant of the Seasons greeted her&mdash;Spring with
arms full of roses, Summer laden with ripe ears of
corn, Autumn bearing purple grapes, and Winter
wrapt in snowy fur; while Minerva was seen closing
the doors of the Temple of Janus, and Juno and
Hymen, with outstretched arms, hailed Francesco,
the son of the great Lodovico, and Christina, the
daughter of Dacia and Austria. At the steps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the Duomo the long procession halted. Cardinal
Gonzaga helped the Duchess to alight, and led her to
the altar, where she knelt in silent prayer, kissed the
<i>pax</i> held up to her by the Archbishop, and received
his benediction. The walls of the long nave were
hung with tapestries, and the choir draped with cloth
of gold and adorned with statues of the patron saints
of Milan. "When you entered the doors," wrote
the chronicler, "you seemed to be in Paradise."</p>

<p>Then the Duchess mounted her horse again, and
the procession passed up the Goldsmiths' Street to
the Castello. Here the decorations were still more
sumptuous. One imposing arch was adorned with
a painting of St. John leaning on the bosom of Christ,
copied from Leonardo's "Cenacolo" in the refectory of
S. Maria delle Grazie. Another bore a figure of Christ
with the orb and sceptre, and the words "Mercy and
Truth have kissed each other." On the piazza in
front of the Castello, a colossal fountain was
erected, and winged children spouted wine and
perfumed water. The Castello itself had been elaborately
adorned. The arms of Denmark and Milan were
carved in fine marble over the portals, the walls were
hung with blue draperies studded with golden stars
and wreathed with garlands of myrtle and ivy, and on
either side of the central doorway two giant warriors
leaning on clubs supported a tablet crowned with the
imperial eagles, and inscribed with the words: "The
wisest of Princes to-day weds the fairest of Virgins,
and brings us the promise of perpetual peace."<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>As the procession reached the gates of the Castello,
a triumphant burst of martial music was sounded
by the trumpeters on the topmost tower, and Count
Massimiliano, the Castellan, presented the golden
keys of the gates to the Duchess, on bended knee.
Christina received them with a gracious smile, and,
accepting his hand, alighted from her horse, amid
the cheers of the populace, who, rushing in on all
sides, seized the baldacchino, tore the costly brocade
into ribbons, and divided the spoil. Meanwhile the
Duke, leaning on a stick, received his wife with a
deep reverence, and led her by the hand into the
beautiful suite of rooms, hung with mulberry-coloured
velvet and cloth of gold, which had been prepared for
her use.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Cardinal Gonzaga and De Praet supped
with the bride and bridegroom that evening, to the
sweet melodies of the Duke's flutes and viols. The
gates of the Castello were closed, enormous bonfires
blazed on the walls, and rockets went up to heaven
from the top of the great tower. Thousands of
torches illumined the darkness, and the streets were
thronged with gay crowds, who gladly took advantage
of the Duke's permission and gave themselves up to
mirth and revelry all night long. Long was that
day remembered in Milan. Old men who could
recall the reign of Lodovico, and had witnessed
the coming of Beatrice and the marriage of Bianca,
wept, and thanked God that they had lived to see this
day. But their joy was destined to be of short
duration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>At six o'clock on the evening of the 4th of May
the marriage of the Duke was finally celebrated in
the hall of the Rocchetta, which was hung with cloth
of gold beautifully decorated with garlands of
flowers. Among the illustrious guests present were
the Cardinal of Mantua, the Legate Caracciolo, Antonio
de Leyva, and the chief nobles and senators. The
Bishops of Modena and Vigevano chanted the nuptial
Mass, and Monseigneur de Praet delivered a lengthy
oration, which sorely tried the patience of his hearers.
No sooner had he uttered the last words than the Duke
took the bride's hand, and brought the ceremony to
an abrupt conclusion by leading her into the banquet-hall.
There a supper of delicate viands, fruit, and
wines, was prepared, and the guests were entertained
with music and songs during the evening.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1534</span>] ALFONSO D'ESTE</div>

<p>Letters of congratulation now poured in from all
the Courts of Europe. Christina's own relatives&mdash;Ferdinand
and Anna, the King and Queen of Hungary
and Bohemia, the King and Queen of Portugal, the
Elector of Saxony and the Marquis of Brandenburg&mdash;all
congratulated the Duchess on her safe arrival and
happy marriage; while the Pope, the Doge of Venice,
and other Italian Princes, sent the Duke cordial
messages. One of the most interesting letters which
the bridegroom received was an autograph epistle
from his cousin, Bona Sforza, Queen of Poland, who
would probably herself have been Duchess of Milan
if Massimiliano Sforza had reigned longer. It had
been the earnest wish of her widowed mother,
Isabella of Aragon, to effect this union, and it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>only after the French conquest of Milan in 1515 that
her daughter became the wife of King Sigismund.
From her distant home Bona kept up an active
correspondence with her Italian relatives, and now
sent Francesco the following friendly letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Dearest and most illustrious Cousin</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"I rejoice sincerely to hear that your most
illustrious wife has reached Milan safely. I feel
the greatest joy at your happy marriage, and trust
that Heaven will send you a fine son. My husband
and children join with me in wishing you every possible
happiness.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">"Bona, Queen.</span><br />
"From Cracow, July 15, 1534."<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>Another of Francesco's illustrious kinsfolk, Alfonso
d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, came to Milan in person to
offer his congratulations to his nephew, although
he preferred to remain incognito, and his name does
not figure among the guests who were present at
the wedding festivities. But Ferrarese chroniclers
record that the Duke went to Milan on the 30th of
April, to attend the wedding of Duke Francesco
Sforza, who took for wife Madame Christierna,
daughter of the King of Dacia, and returned home on
the 6th of May.<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Forty-four years before, Alfonso, then
a boy of fourteen, had accompanied his sister Beatrice
to Milan for her marriage, and escorted his own bride,
Anna Sforza, back to Ferrara. Now his long and
troubled life was drawing to a close, and he died a few
months after this last journey to Milan, on the 31st
of October, 1534. By his last will he left two of his
best horses and a pair of falcons to his beloved
nephew, the Duke of Milan.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Some writers have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>conjectured that Alfonso brought his favourite
painter, Titian, to Milan, and that the Venetian
master painted portraits of the Duke and Duchess
on this occasion.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> No record of Titian's visit, however,
has been discovered, and he probably painted
the portraits of Francesco and Christina from drawings
sent to him at Venice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1534</span>] TITIAN'S PORTRAIT</div>

<p>Titian's friend, Pietro Aretino, was in constant
correspondence with Count Massimiliano Stampa,
who rewarded his literary efforts with gifts of gold
chains, velvet caps, and embroidered doublets. "I
shall be clad in your presents all through the summer
months," he wrote in a letter, signing himself, "Your
younger brother and devoted servant." Aretino
was not only profuse in thanks to this noble patron,
but sent him choice works of art, mirrors of Oriental
crystal, medals engraved by Anichino, and, best of
all, a little painting of the youthful Baptist clasping
a lamb, "so life-like that a sheep would bleat at the
sight of it."<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> The wily Venetian was exceedingly
anxious to ingratiate himself with the Duke of Milan,
and not only dedicated a "Paraphase" to him on
his marriage, but, according to Vasari, painted
portraits of both the Duke and Duchess. These
pictures were reproduced by Campo in the "History
of Cremona," which he published in 1585, while
Christina was still living. The portrait of Francesco
was at that time the property of the Milanese noble
Mario Amigone, while that of Christina hung in the
house of Don Antonio Lomboni, President of the
Magistrates.<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> This last portrait was afterwards sent
to Florence by order of the Grand-Duke Ferdinand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>who married the Duchess's granddaughter, Christine
of Lorraine.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I send Your Highness," wrote Guido Mazzenta in
January, 1604, "the portrait of the Most Serene
Lady, Christina, Queen of Denmark, and grandmother
of the Most Serene Grand-Duchess, painted
by Titian, by order of Duke Francesco Sforza, when
he brought her to Milan as his bride."<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, this precious portrait was afterwards
sent to Madrid, where it is said to have perished in
a fire. In Campo's engraving the youthful Duchess
wears a jewelled cap and pearl necklace, with an ermine
cape on her shoulders. Her serene air and thoughtful
expression recall Holbein's famous picture, and give
an impression of quiet happiness and content which
agrees with all that we know of her short married life.</p>

<p>The change was great from Malines and Brussels,
and Christina often missed her old playmates.
But her simple, docile nature became easily accustomed
to these new surroundings, and the affectionate
little letters which she sent to her aunt and sister all
breathe the same strain. "We are as happy and
contented as possible," she writes to Dorothea; and
when Camillo Ghilino was starting for Germany, she
sends a few words, at her lord's suggestion, to be
forwarded to Flanders, just to tell her aunt how much
she loves and thinks of her.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>Certainly, when we compare her lot with that of
her mother, and remember the hardships and sorrows
which the young Queen had to endure, Christina
may well have counted herself fortunate. Her
husband treated his child-wife with the greatest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>kindness. Her smallest wish was gratified, her tastes
were consulted in every particular. The rooms
which she occupied in the Rocchetta, where his mother,
Duchess Beatrice, had lived, were hung with rich
crimson velvet; the walls of her bedroom were draped
with pale blue silk; a new loggia was built, looking
out on the gardens and moat waters. The breaches
which French and Spanish guns had made in the
walls were repaired, and the Castello resumed its old
aspect. Three state carriages, lined with costly
brocades and drawn by four horses draped with cloth
of gold, were prepared by the Duke for his wife, and
were first used by the Duchess on Ascension Day,
when, ten days after her wedding, she made her first
appearance in public. As she drove to the Duomo,
followed by the Legate and Ambassadors, and escorted
by a brilliant cavalcade of nobles, the streets were
thronged with eager crowds, who greeted her with
acclamation, and waited for hours to catch a sight
of her face. On Corpus Christi, again, a few weeks
later, the Duke and Duchess both came to see the
long procession of Bishops and priests pass through
the streets, bearing the host under a stately canopy
from the Duomo to the ancient shrine of S. Ambrogio.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1534</span>] FRANCESCA PALEOLOGA</div>

<p>The popularity of the young Duchess soon became
unbounded. Her tall figure, dark eyes, and fair
hair, excited the admiration of all her subjects, while
her frank and kindly manners won every heart.
Although prices went up in Milan that year, and the
tolls on corn and wine were doubled, the people paid
these dues cheerfully, and, when they sat down to a
scanty meal, remarked that they must pay for Her
Excellency's dinner.<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> Fortunately, by the end of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>year there was a considerable fall in prices, and a
general sense of relief and security prevailed.</p>

<p>To the Duke himself, as well as to his people, the
coming of the Duchess brought new life. For a time
his failing health revived in the sunshine of her
presence. He threw himself with energy into the
task of beautifying Milan and completing the fa&ccedil;ade
of the Duomo. At the same time he employed
painters to decorate the Castello and Duomo of
Vigevano, and an illuminated book of the Gospels,
adorned with exquisite miniatures and bearing his arms
and those of the Duchess, may still be seen in the Brera.</p>

<p>Hunting-parties were held for Christina's amusement
both at Vigevano and in Count Massimiliano's
woods at Cussago. Madame de Souvastre and most
of the Duchess's Flemish attendants had returned to
the Netherlands with De Praet, and Francesco took
great pains to provide his wife with a congenial
lady-in-waiting. His choice fell on Francesca Paleologa,
a lady of the noble house of Montferrat, and
cousin of the newly-married Duchess of Mantua.
Her husband, Constantine Comnenus, titular Prince
of Macedonia, had served under the Pope and
Emperor; and her daughter, Deianira, had lately
married Count Gaspare Trivulzio, a former partisan
of the French, who was now a loyal subject of the
Duke. From this time the Princess of Macedonia
became Christina's inseparable companion, and remained
devotedly attached to the Duchess throughout
her long life. At the same time Francesco appointed
one of his secretaries, Benedetto da Corte of Pavia,
to be master of the Duchess's household, and to teach
her Italian, which she was soon able to speak and
write fluently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>The Milanese archives contain several charming
little notes written in Christina's large, round hand
to the Duke during a brief visit which he paid to
Vigevano, for change of air, in the summer of 1535:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">My Lord and dearest Husband</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"I have received your dear letters, and rejoice
to hear of your welfare. This has been a great
comfort to me, but it will be a far greater pleasure to
see you again. I look forward to your return with
such impatience that a single hour seems as long
as a whole year. May God keep you safe and bring
you home again very soon, for I can enjoy nothing
without Your Excellency. I am very well, thank
God, and commend myself humbly to your good
graces. Signora Francesca is also well, and commends
herself to Your Highness.</p>

<p class="right">
"Your very humble wife,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Christierna</span>.<br />
"Milan, June 7, 1535.<br />
</p>

<p>"The bearer of this letter has been very good to
me."</p></div>

<p>Francesco's health had lately given fresh cause for
anxiety. He suffered from catarrh and fever, and
was frequently confined to his bed. A Pavian Envoy
who had been promised an audience had to leave
the Castello without seeing His Excellency, and a
visit which he and the Duchess had intended to pay
to Pavia in the spring was put off, to the great disappointment
of the loyal citizens. Now his absence
was prolonged owing to a fresh attack of illness, and
the young wife wrote again at the end of the month,
lamenting the delay and expressing the same impatience
for his return:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

dear letter of the 20th instant, but should have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>much better pleased to see you and enjoy the pleasure
of your presence, as I hoped to do by this time,
especially as these Signors assured me that your
absence would be short. But they were, it is plain,
quite wrong. However, I must be reasonable, and
if your prolonged absence is necessary I will not
complain. I thank you for your kind excuses and
explanations, but I will not thank you for saying that
I need not trouble to write to you with my own
hand, because this at least is labour well spent, and
I am only happy when I can talk with Your Excellency
or write to you, now that I cannot enjoy your
company. I commend myself infinitely to your remembrance,
and trust God may long preserve you,
and grant you a safe and speedy return.</p>

<p>But the warm-hearted young wife's wish remained
unfulfilled, and four months after these lines were
written Christina was a widow.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1535</span>] THE PALATINE</div>

<p>The chief event of Christina's brief married life
was the marriage of her elder sister, the Princess of
Denmark. Dorothea was by this time an attractive
girl of fourteen, shorter and slighter than her sister,
and inferior to her in force of character, but full of
brightness and gaiety. She was very popular in her
old home at Malines, and often shot with a crossbow
at the meetings of the Guild of Archers. Several
marriages had been proposed for her, and King
James of Scotland had repeatedly asked for her
hand; but the Emperor hesitated to accept his
advances, from fear of offending King Francis,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>whose daughter Magdalen had long been pledged to
this fickle monarch, while the difficulty of providing
a dower and outfit for another portionless niece, made
Mary reluctant to conclude a second marriage. But,
a few months after Christina's marriage, a new suitor
for Dorothea's hand came forward in the person of
the Count Palatine, who had vainly aspired to wed
both Eleanor of Austria and Mary of Hungary.
Frederic's loyal support of Charles's claims to the
imperial crown, and his gallant defence of Vienna
against the Turks, had been scurvily rewarded, and
hitherto all his attempts to find another bride had
been foiled. When, in 1526, after the King of
Portugal's death, he approached his old love, the
widowed Queen Eleanor, his advances were coldly
repelled; and when he asked King Ferdinand for one
of his daughters, he was told that she was too young
for him. After Mary of Hungary's refusal, he left
the Imperial Court in anger, and told Charles V. that
he would take a French wife;<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> but Isabel of Navarre,
Margaret of Montferrat, and the King of Poland's
daughter, all eluded his efforts, and when he asked
for Mary Tudor's hand, King Henry told him that
he could not insult his good friend and cousin by
offering him a bride born out of wedlock.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Now Ferdinand,
unwilling to lose so valuable an ally, suddenly
proposed that the Palatine should marry his niece
Dorothea, saying that both he and Charles would
rejoice to see him reigning over the three northern
kingdoms. At first Frederic hesitated, saying that
he was a grey-headed man of fifty, little fitted to be
the husband of so young a lady, and had no wish
to reign over the turbulent Norsemen. Mary, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>ever,
welcomed her brother's proposal, regarding it
as a means of strengthening the Emperor's cause in
Northern Europe. In Denmark the succession of
Frederic's son Christian III. was disputed, and a
Hanseatic fleet had seized Copenhagen, while Christopher
of Oldenburg, a cousin of the captive King,
had invaded Jutland. With the help of these allies
it might be possible for the Palatine to recover his
wife's inheritance. But the execution of this plan
was full of difficulties, as Prince John's old tutor,
the wise Archbishop of Lunden, told Charles V. in a
letter which he addressed to him in the autumn of
1534:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<span class="smcap">Most sacred C&aelig;sar</span>,&mdash;I know Denmark well, and
am convinced that the Danes will never recognize
Christian II. as their King. Count Christopher's
expedition will prove a mere flash in the pan, and
when he can no longer pay his men, the peasants,
who flocked to his banner at the sound of their old
King's name, will return to their hearths. Then the
nobles will have their revenge, and the proud L&uuml;beck
citizens will seize Denmark and establish the Lutheran
religion in the name of Christopher or King Henry of
England, or any other Prince, as long as he is not
Your Majesty; and if they succeed, the trade of the
Low Countries will be ruined."<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p></div>

<p>The bait held out to the Palatine, however, proved
too alluring, and he easily fell a victim to the snare.
The Emperor sent him flattering messages by Hubert,
the faithful servant who has left us so delightful a
chronicle of his master's doings, and promised his
niece a dowry of 50,000 crowns. It was late on
New Year's Eve when Hubert reached his master's
house at Neumarkt, on his return from Spain, and
Frederic was already in bed; but he sent for him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
bade him tell his news in three words. The messenger
exclaimed joyfully: "I bring my lord a royal bride,
a most gracious Kaiser, and a sufficient dowry."
Upon which the Palatine thanked God, and bade
Hubert go to the cellar and help himself to food
and drink.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

<p>One of Charles's most trusted Flemish servants,
Nicholas de Marnol, was now sent to Milan, to obtain
the consent of the Duke and Duchess to Dorothea's
marriage. After a perilous journey over the Alps in
snow and floods, Marnol reached Milan on the 10th
of January, 1535, and received a cordial welcome.
Francesco approved warmly of a union which would
insure the Princess's happiness and serve to confirm
the peace of Germany, but quite declined to accept
the Emperor's suggestion that he should help to
provide a pension for Christina's brother-in-law,
saying that this was impossible, and that His Majesty
would be the first to recognize the futility of making
promises which cannot be kept.</p>

<p>After a short stay at Milan, Marnol went on to
Vienna, and advised the Palatine to go to Spain
himself if he wished to settle the matter. Frederic,
always glad of an excuse for a journey, travelled by
way of Brussels and France to Saragossa, and accompanied
the Emperor to Barcelona, where Charles
signed the marriage contract on the eve of sailing for
Africa.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1535</span>] A HAPPY MARRIAGE</div>

<p>On the 18th of May, 1535, the marriage was
solemnized at Brussels, and Frederic consented to
leave his bride with her aunt until her outfit was
completed. Queen Eleanor expressed the liveliest
interest in her old lover's marriage, and insisted on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>seeing Dorothea before she went to Germany. At
length the wedding-party reached Heidelberg, on the
8th of September, where the gallant bridegroom,
who, in Hubert's words, "loved to shine," rode out
in rich attire to meet his bride, and escorted her with
martial music and pomp worthy of a King's daughter
to the famous castle on the heights. The next day
the nuptial Mass was celebrated by the Bishop of
Spires, and a series of splendid entertainments were
given by Frederic's brother, the Elector Louis, after
which the Count took his bride to his own home at
Neumarkt, in the Upper Palatinate.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p>"Now at length," wrote Hubert, "my lord thought
that he had attained a haven of rest, and found a
blessed end to all his troubles; but he was grievously
mistaken, and soon realized that he had embarked
on a new and tempestuous ocean."<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>The splendid prospects of recovering his wife's
kingdom were destined to prove utterly fallacious,
and only involved him in heavy expenses and perpetual
intrigues. The Emperor, as he soon discovered,
"had no great affection for the enterprise
of Denmark,"<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> and before long Copenhagen surrendered,
and Charles and Mary were compelled to
come to terms with Christian III. and acknowledge
his title. Fortunately, in all other respects his
marriage proved a happy one. Dorothea was greatly
beloved by her husband's family and subjects, and made
him a devoted wife, although, as Hubert soon found
out, she was as great a spendthrift as her lord, and confessed
that she was never happy until she had spent
her last penny.<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> The very frivolity of her nature
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>suited the volatile Count. She shared his love of
adventure, and was always ready to accompany him
on perilous journeys, to climb mountains or ford
rivers, with the same unquenchable courage and
gaiety of heart. Even when, in her anxiety to bear
a child, she imitated the example of Frederic's mother,
the old Countess Palatine, and went on pilgrimages
and wore holy girdles, "this was done without
any spirit of devotion, but with great mirth and
laughter. And how little," adds the chronicler,
"either pilgrimages or girdles profited her, we all
know."<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>Before the Palatine and his bride reached Heidelberg,
Europe was thrilled by the news of the capture
of Tunis, and the flight of the hated Barbarossa before
his conqueror. It was the proudest moment of the
Emperor's life. Twenty thousand Christian captives
were released that day, and went home to spread the
fame of their great deliverer throughout the civilized
world. The news reached Milan on the 2nd of
August, and was hailed with universal joy. <i>Te
Deums</i> were chanted in the Duomo, bells were rung
in all the churches, and the guns of the Castello
boomed in honour of the great event. Camillo Ghilino
was immediately sent by the Duke to congratulate the
Emperor on his victory, and thank His Majesty once
more for all the happiness which the generous gift of
his niece had brought Francesco and his people.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1535</span>] FRANCESCO SFORZA'S DEATH</div>

<p>The late Pope, Clement VII., had already expressed
his intention of rewarding Ghilino's services with a
Cardinal's hat, and his successor, Paul III., would
probably have kept his promise, but the Ambassador
fell ill in Sicily, and died at Palermo in September,
to the Duke's great sorrow.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Soon after receiving
the news, Francesco himself fell ill of fever, and once
more lost the use of his limbs. All through October
he grew steadily worse, and by the end of the month
the people of Milan learnt that their beloved Prince
was at the point of death. On Monday, the Feast of
All Saints, the public anxiety was at its height, and
silent crowds waited all day at the gates of the Castello
to hear the latest reports. At length, early in the
morning of All Souls' Day, they learnt that the last
Sforza Duke was no more. Christina watched by his
bedside to the end, and wept bitterly, for, in the
chronicler's words, "they had loved each other
well."<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> All Milan shared in her grief, and nothing but
sobbing and wailing was heard in the streets. Everyone
lamented the good Duke, and grieved for the
troubles and misery which his death would bring on
the land. But the city remained tranquil, and there
was no tumult or rioting. This was chiefly due to
Stampa, who, by the Duke's last orders, took charge
of the Duchess, and administered public affairs in her
name, until instructions could be received from C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>A messenger was despatched without delay to the
Emperor at Palermo, with letters from the Count
and a touching little note from Christina, informing
her uncle how her dear lord's weakness had gradually
increased, until in the early morning he passed to a
better life. The dead Prince lay in state for three
days in the ducal chapel, clad in robes of crimson
velvet and ermine, on a bier surrounded by lighted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>tapers. But the funeral was put off till the 19th of
November, in order, writes the chronicler, to give
the people time to show the love they bore their
lamented master, and also because of the difficulty
of obtaining sufficient black cloth to drape the walls
of the Castello and put the Court in mourning. It
was a sad time for the young widow. During three
weeks not a ray of light was allowed to penetrate
the gloom of the funereal hall where she sat with
her ladies, while solemn requiems and Masses were
chanted in the chapel.</p>

<p>It had been Francesco's wish to sleep with his
parents in the Church of S. Maria delle Grazie, where
the effigies of Lodovico and his lost Beatrice had
been carved in marble. But when this became
known there was a general outcry. The people
would not allow their beloved Duke to be buried
anywhere but in the Duomo with the great Francesco
and the other Sforza Princes. So it was decided only
to bury the Duke's heart in the Dominican church.
His body was laid in a leaden casket covered with
black velvet, and a wax effigy, wearing the ducal
crown and robes, was exposed to public view.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1535</span>] FUNERAL RITES</div>

<p>Late on Friday, the 19th of November, an imposing
funeral procession passed from the Castello to the
Duomo, through the same streets which, only
eighteen months before, had been decked in festive
array to receive the late Duke's bride. First came
the Bishops and clergy with candles and crosses, then
the senators, magistrates, and nobles, wearing long
black mantles and hoods. After them gentlemen
bearing the ducal standard, cap, and baton, and
Francesco's sword and helmet, and what moved the
spectators more than all, the white mule which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
had ridden daily, led by four pages, "looking just
as it did when His Excellency was alive, only that the
saddle was empty." Then the bier was carried past,
under a gold canopy, and the wax effigy of the dead
man, was seen clad in gold brocade and ermine, with
a vest of crimson velvet and red shoes and stockings.
Immediately behind rode the chief mourner, Giovanni
Paolo Sforza, followed by Antonio de Leyva, the
Imperial and Venetian Ambassadors, the Chancellor
Taverna, Count Massimiliano Stampa, and the chief
Ministers and officials. After them came a vast
multitude of poor, all in mourning, bearing lighted
tapers, and weeping as they went. A catafalque, surrounded
with burning torches, had been erected in
the centre of the Duomo, and here, under a canopy
of black velvet, the Duke's effigy was laid on a couch
of gold brocade, with his sword at his side and the
ducal cap and baton at his feet&mdash;"a thing," says
the chronicler, "truly marvellous to see."<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>The next morning the funeral rites were celebrated
in the presence of an immense concourse of people,
and a Latin oration was delivered by Messer Gualtiero
di Corbetta. During three days requiems were
chanted at every altar in the Duomo, and the great
bell, which had never been rung before, was tolled
for the space of three hours, accompanied by all the
bells of the other churches in Milan. "And there
was no one with heart so hard that he was not moved
to tears that day," writes Burigozzo, the chronicler
who was a living witness of the love which the citizens
bore to their dead Duke.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> At the end of the week
the casket containing Francesco's remains was finally
laid in a richly carved sarcophagus, which had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>originally intended to receive the ashes of Gaston de
Foix, the victor of Ravenna, and which was now
placed against the wall of the choir, "for a perpetual
memorial in the sight of all Milan."<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>No one loved the Duke better and lamented his
loss more truly than Count Massimiliano Stampa, and
Pietro Aretino, who realized this, condoled with his
noble friend, and at the same time paid an eloquent
tribute to the dead Prince, in the following letter:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duke is dead, and I feel that this sad event
has not only taken away all your happiness, but part
of your own soul. I know the close intimacy in
which you lived, nourished in your infancy at the
same breast, and bound together in one heart and
soul. But you must take comfort, remembering that
His Excellency may well be called fortunate in his
end. His wanderings began when he was barely six
years old, and he was driven into exile before he
was old enough to remember his native land. After
so many wars and labours, after experiencing famine
and sickness himself, and seeing the cruel misery and
affliction endured by his subjects, he lived to see
perfect tranquillity restored in his dominions, and
to enjoy the passionate affection of all Milan. Now,
secure in the friendship of C&aelig;sar and the love of Italy,
he has given back his spirit to God who gave it.
Rejoice, therefore, and render praise and glory to
Francesco Sforza's name, because by his wisdom and
virtue he conquered fortune, and has died a Prince
on his throne, reigning in peace and happiness over
his native land. So, my dear lord, I beg you dry
your tears, and meet those who love you as I do
with a serene brow. The fame of your learning
and greatness is known everywhere. Rise above the
blows of fate, and console yourself with the thought
of your Duke's blessed end. There lies His Excellency's
corpse. Give it honourable burial, and I
meanwhile will not cease to celebrate him dead and
you who are alive."<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p></div>

<h2>BOOK V<br />

THE WIDOW OF MILAN<br />

1535-1538</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Christina's short married life was over. At the end
of eighteen months she found herself a widow, before
she had completed her fourteenth year. But the
brief interval which had elapsed since she left Flanders
had sufficed to turn the child into a woman. From the
moment of the Duke's death, her good sense and discretion
won golden opinions from the grey-headed
statesmen around her. The senators and Ambassadors,
the deputies from Pavia and the other Lombard
cities, who came to offer their condolences, were
deeply moved at the sight of this Princess, whose
heavy mourning and widow's weeds contrasted
strangely with her extreme youth. The dignity and
grace of her bearing charmed them still more, and all
the Milanese asked was to keep their Duchess among
them. By the terms of the late Duke's investiture, if
he died without children, the duchy of Milan was to
revert to the Emperor, but the city of Tortona was
settled on the Duchess. By Francesco's will the town
and Castello of Vigevano, which he had done so much
to beautify, were also bequeathed to her. Immediately
after the Duke's funeral, in obedience to his
dying lord's order, Stampa hoisted the imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
standard on the Castello of Milan, but refused to
allow Antonio de Leyva to take possession of the
citadel until he received orders from C&aelig;sar himself.
This was faithfully reported to the Emperor by
Christina, who gave her uncle a full account of the
steps which she had taken to administer affairs as her
lord's representative, adding:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If I have failed in any part of my duty or done
anything contrary to Your Majesty's wishes, I beg
you to excuse my ignorance, assuring you that I
have acted by the advice of my late husband's Councillors,
and with no regard to my own interests, but
with the sole object of promoting Your Majesty's
honour and service, and remain</p>

<p>The messenger whom Stampa sent to Palermo on
the day of the Duke's death missed the Emperor,
who had already left for Messina, and the news did
not reach him until he had landed in Calabria, on
his way to Naples. It was not till the 27th of November
that a horseman bearing letters from C&aelig;sar
arrived in Milan. Here intense anxiety prevailed
among all classes, and the Spaniards were as much
hated as the Duke and Duchess had been beloved.
Accordingly, the relief was great when it became
known that, although Signor Antonio de Leyva was
appointed Governor-General, Stampa was to retain
his post as Castellan, and the Duchess was to remain
in the Castello.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duchess remains Duchess," wrote the chronicler,
"and all the other officials retain their places.
Above all, Count Massimiliano keeps his office, and
the city is perfectly quiet."<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a></p></div>

<p>Stampa now made a last effort to maintain the
independence of Milan. He proposed that the
widowed Duchess should be given in marriage to the
Duke of Savoy's eldest son, Louis, a Prince of her
own age, who was being educated at his imperial
uncle's Court. A petition to this effect, signed by
Chancellor Taverna and all the leading senators, was
addressed to the Emperor, and Giovanni Paolo Sforza
was sent to Rome to meet His Majesty and obtain
the Pope's support.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Gian Paolo Sforza and Taverna," wrote the
Venetian Envoy, Lorenzo Bragadin, "have begged
C&aelig;sar to give the hand of his niece, the widow, to
the Duke of Savoy's son, and this is the wish of all
the people of Milan."<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, Giovanni Paolo fell ill on the
journey, and breathed his last in a village of the
Apennines, and before Charles left Naples he heard
that the promising young Prince of Piedmont had
died on Christmas Day at Madrid. His brother,
Emanuel Philibert, was a child of seven, and although
his ambitious mother, Duchess Beatrix, hastened to
put forward his claim, nothing more was heard of
the scheme.</p>

<p>By this time another marriage for Christina was
being seriously discussed at the Imperial Court.
Even before the Duke's death, the French King had
done his best to provoke a quarrel with him, and had
begun to make active preparations for war. Hardly
had Francesco breathed his last, than he openly
renewed his old claim to Milan, and sent an Ambassador
to the Emperor at Naples, demanding the duchy for
his second son, Henry, Duke of Orleans, the husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
of Catherine de' Medici. This plan, which would have
made the French supreme in North Italy, could not
be entertained for a moment, but Charles, in his
anxiety to avoid war, was ready to accept almost any
other alternative. When his sister Eleanor implored
him to agree to her husband's proposal, and, by way
of cementing the alliance, give "the little widow of
Milan" in marriage to the King's third son, the Duke
of Angoul&ecirc;me, he replied that he would gladly treat
of the proposed marriage, but only on condition that
Angoul&ecirc;me, not Orleans, was put in possession of
Milan.</p>

<p>The union of the French Prince with Christina
now became the subject of prolonged negotiations
between the two Courts. The Imperial Chancellor,
Granvelle, drew up a long and careful memorandum,
dwelling on the obvious advantages of the scheme,
on the virtues and charms of the young Duchess, on
her large dowry and great popularity in Milan, and
Charles told Francis plainly that he would agree to
no scheme by which the widowed Duchess was removed
from the State, "where she was so much
beloved and honoured, and where the people placed
all their hopes of tranquillity in her presence." One
great object of these negotiations, he wrote, "is to
find a noble and suitable husband for our niece, the
Widow of Milan, who is to us almost a daughter,
and who has always shown herself so discreet and
so obedient to our wishes."<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1536</span>] MANY SUITORS</div>

<p>Both the Pope and the Venetians supported this
scheme as the best means of avoiding war and preserving
the independence of Milan. At the same
time Pope Paul did not fail to put in a plea for his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>own kinsman, the son of his niece Cecilia Farnese,
and Count Bosio Sforza, a descendant of Francesco
I.'s half-brother. Bosio had been a loyal
supporter of the late Duke, but died soon after
Christina's marriage, leaving a son of fifteen, who
was brought up at the Court of Milan. The Pope
himself addressed a grateful letter to Christina,
thanking her for the kindness which she had shown
the boy, and throwing out a hint that a marriage
with her young Sforza cousin might be possible.
Another husband whom Granvelle proposed for her was
Duke Alexander of Florence, but, fortunately, Charles
decided to give him his own illegitimate daughter
Margaret, and Christina thus escaped union with
this reckless and profligate Prince, who was soon
afterwards murdered by his kinsman.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> Meanwhile
the Scottish Ambassadors at the French Court made
proposals to the Emperor on behalf of their King,
James V., who had not yet made up his mind to
wed Magdalen of Valois, and these negotiations were
only interrupted by the high-handed action of King
Henry's new favourite, Thomas Cromwell. Thus,
a few weeks after the Duke of Milan's death his
widow's hand had become the subject of animated
controversy in all the Courts of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>But while others were negotiating the French were
arming. On the 6th of March, the first day of
Carnival, news reached Milan that a French army
had crossed the Alps. The strong citadel of Montm&eacute;lian
was betrayed by the treachery of a Neapolitan
captain, and after a gallant defence the Duke of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>Savoy was compelled to evacuate Turin, and take
refuge with his wife and children at Vercelli. All
hope of peace was now over, and, in a consistory held
in the Vatican on the 8th of April, the Emperor
appealed to the Pope to bear witness how earnestly
he had tried to prevent war, and how fruitless his
efforts had proved. At Granvelle's suggestion, he
determined to carry the war into the enemy's country,
and, following in the steps of Charles VIII., crossed
the Apennines, and marched by the Emilian Way and
along the banks of the Po towards Asti.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1536</span>] MEETING WITH CHARLES V.</div>

<p>The dread of a French invasion had united all
parties in Milan. The citizens forgot their hatred
of the Spaniards in their terror of another siege, and
cheerfully submitted to fresh taxes to pay the
defending army. It was a late spring that year in
Lombardy, the weather was bitterly cold, and by the
end of April the vines had only put forth tiny shoots,
and the roses were not yet in flower. Nothing was
heard in the streets but the din of approaching warfare,
and the tramp of armed <i>Landsknechten</i> marching
from Tyrol on their way to the frontier. But in
the last days of April Christina's dull life was
brightened by the sudden arrival of the Duchess of
Savoy, who fled from the camp at Vercelli to take
refuge in the Castello of Milan. Times were altered
since the two Princesses had met at Turin, and the
Duchess Beatrix, who had welcomed the little bride
so warmly, was sadly changed in body and mind.
She had lost her eldest son, and been driven out of
her home by foreign invaders, never to return there
again in her lifetime. With her she brought her two
remaining children, the little Princess Catherine and
Emanuel Philibert, who was one day to become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
famous as the bravest captain in Europe. And she
also brought a treasure which excited the utmost
enthusiasm among the Milanese&mdash;the Holy Shroud
of St. Joseph of Arimathea, which had been preserved
for centuries at Chamb&eacute;ry. Crowds flocked to the
Duomo when Beatrix's Franciscan confessor preached,
in the hope of seeing the precious Shroud; but the
Duchess would not allow the relic to leave the Castello,
and on the 7th it was exposed on the ramparts to
the view of an enormous multitude assembled in the
piazza.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>A week later Francesco Sforza's cousin, Ferrante
Gonzaga, and the Duke of Savoy, came to Milan, but
soon left for the camp. Beatrix then obtained permission
to pay the Emperor a visit on his journey
north, and by Charles's express request took Christina
with her. On the 18th of May the magistrates of
Pavia received orders from the Duchess of Milan's
<i>maggiordomo</i>, Benedetto da Corte, to prepare lodgings
for Her Excellency and the Duchess of Savoy, as
near to each other as possible.<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> The Castello of
Pavia had suffered terribly in the siege by Lautrec
in 1528, but a few rooms were hastily furnished,
and on the 20th Beatrix and Christina arrived,
escorted by Count Massimiliano and several courtiers.
Early on the following morning the two Duchesses
rode out to Arena on the Po, where they found the
Emperor awaiting them. Charles was unfeignedly
glad to see both his sister-in-law and the niece whom
he had left as a child at Brussels four years before,
and welcomed them affectionately.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> But the inter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>view
was a short one, and the next day he continued
his journey to Asti, where he joined Antonio de
Leyva and Ferrante Gonzaga, and prepared to invade
Provence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1536</span>] CARDINAL CARACCIOLO</div>

<p>Meanwhile Beatrix and Christina returned to Milan,
and spent the summer together in the Castello. A
close friendship sprang up between the two Duchesses.
Beatrix took a motherly interest in her young companion,
and the children's presence helped to cheer
these anxious months. At first the Emperor's arms
were entirely successful. The French retired before
him to Avignon, laying the country waste, and he
met with no opposition until he reached Aix, which
resisted all his attacks. During the long siege which
followed, his soldiers suffered severely from disease
and famine, and many youths of the noblest Milanese
families were among the victims.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> Early in September,
while Christina's own secretary, Belcorpo, was
robbed and murdered on his way to the camp,
Antonio de Leyva, the redoubtable Commander-in-Chief,
died, and was buried in S. Eustorgio at Milan.
The Papal Legate, Cardinal Caracciolo, a Neapolitan
by birth, was appointed to succeed him as Viceroy
of Milan. He had only just assumed the reins of
office, and paid his first visit to the young Duchess,
when he received a summons from the Emperor to
join him at Genoa. Finding it impossible to reduce
Aix, Charles had determined to abandon the campaign,
and on the 16th of November a three months'
truce was signed between the two monarchs. The
Emperor was anxious to return to Spain, where his
presence was sorely needed. But before his departure
he sent for the Cardinal, desiring him to leave some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>trusty lieutenant to govern the State in his absence,
and take charge of his niece the Duchess. Accordingly,
Caracciolo went to Genoa on the 4th of October,
accompanied by Beatrix of Savoy, who, after a long
interview with the Emperor, joined her husband at
Nice, the only city which still belonged to him.
Soon after this her health gave way under the prolonged
strain, and this once brilliant and beautiful
woman died in January, 1538, as she said herself, of
a broken heart.</p>

<p>Christina, now left alone at Milan, wrote a long
letter to the Cardinal, whom she addressed in the
language of a caressing child, saying that he was
dear to her as a father, and seeking his help for two
objects which lay very near her heart.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The true affection," she writes, "which Your
Excellency has shown me, and the kind remembrance
of me which you always keep, makes me
anxious for your health and welfare. So I beg
you to tell me how you have prospered on your
journey, and if you are well in health."</p></div>

<p>She then begs her friend the Cardinal to use his
influence with the Emperor on behalf of her sister
Dorothea, "the person now nearest and dearest to
her on earth," who is in need of her powerful uncle's
help. Probably the Palatine was, as usual, endeavouring
to recover arrears of the pension due to him by
the Emperor, and to obtain compensation for the
costs which he had incurred in the disastrous expedition
against Copenhagen. Hubert had lately
been sent to Charles with this object, and had at the
same time suggested that, if the Emperor needed a
Viceroy for Milan, no one could be more suitable
than his lord. But whatever the precise object of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Dorothea's request may have been, Christina's intercession,
it is to be feared, availed her little.</p>

<p>The Duchess's other petition was more easily
granted.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As a whole year," she wrote, "will soon have
elapsed since the death of my dearest husband, of
blessed memory, I beg you to entreat His Majesty, in
my name, to be pleased to give orders that this
anniversary may be observed in a due and fitting
manner. And I am quite certain that he will not
refuse to hear this my prayer."<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p></div>

<p>It would indeed have been impossible for the
Emperor to refuse so reasonable a request, and the
anniversary of the late Duke's death was observed
with due ceremonial in all the churches of Milan.
But the days of the young Duchess's abode in this
city were fast drawing to a close. Before Charles left
Italy he had determined to place a strong Spanish
garrison in the Castello, to defend Milan against the
risk of a French invasion, and had only delayed to
take this step from fear of exciting discontent in the
city. Stampa had hitherto succeeded in warding off
the blow, but now he was forced to bow to the
imperial command, and surrender the Castello to
a foreign captain.</p>

<p>Charles, it must be owned, did his best to soften
the blow. He made the Count a present of the rich
fief of Soncino in the province of Cremona, and sent
him as a parting gift the costly plate which had
belonged to the late Duke, with a cordial invitation
to follow him to Spain. But we see, from a letter
which Stampa's friend Aretino sent him, how sorely
this vexed his noble heart.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1536</span>] ARETINO'S COMFORT</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I will not grieve, my illustrious friend," wrote the
time-serving Venetian, "if you have to give up the
Castello, which you held for love of His Excellency,
of happy memory, because to my mind it was a
prison for your genius. Dry your tears, and console
yourself with the reflection that now at least you are
a free man. His Majesty is relieved from the jealousy
of his Spanish servants, and you are saved from
further anxieties on this subject. Now you can, if
you choose, follow him to Spain, and lay down your
office with honour unstained, and then return to
Milan to live in freedom and contentment."<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p></div>

<p>This was poor comfort for Massimiliano, but the
Emperor's will was not to be gainsaid, and the Count
could only lay down his office and take leave of the
young Duchess, assuring her of his undying loyalty
and faithfulness. Charles had not forgotten his niece,
and before he sailed for Barcelona on the 15th of
November he sent one of his oldest and most trusted
servants, Jean de Montmorency, Sieur de Courri&egrave;res,
the Captain of the Archers' Guard, to take charge of
the Duchess, and eventually conduct her to Flanders.
But while negotiations for her second marriage were
still pending, it was felt desirable that she should
remain in Lombardy; and since the Castello would
no longer be a fit place for her, Montmorency was
ordered to escort her to Pavia. On the 10th of December,
1536, De Courri&egrave;res arrived with fifty archers of
the Imperial Guard, and, after a brief consultation
with the Cardinal and Stampa, decided to take the
Duchess to Pavia without delay.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>The leaves of the trees in the gardens were turning
yellow, and a pale wintry sun shone down on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>Castello, which Christina had first seen in the joyous
May-time, when a little procession of black-robed
ladies, with their attendants, issued from the
Rocchetta, and mounted the horses and litters in
waiting for them. A few bystanders saluted them
reverently, and followed them with wistful eyes as
they rode out of the gates, down the street leading to
the Porta Ticinese, until they were out of sight.</p>

<p>A few days later Count Massimiliano Stampa
marched out of the Castello at the head of his troops,
and gave up the keys, which he had received from the
last Sforza Duke, to the Spanish Captain Alvarez de
Luna, who entered the gates amid the curses and
groans of the citizens. Henceforth the life of Milan
as an independent State was over, and the yoke of
Spain descended on the ancient capital of Lombardy.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1536</span>] A PALACE IN RUINS</div>

<p>The city of Pavia had always been loyal to the
House of Sforza. In no part of the duchy was there
greater rejoicing on the restoration of Duke Francesco
II.; nowhere was his premature death more
deeply lamented. Several of Christina's most faithful
servants were natives of Pavia; among others, Benedetto
da Corte, the master of her household, and Bottigella,
who had been so active in the preparations for
her reception. Now the people of Pavia welcomed her
coming warmly, and exerted themselves to see that
nothing was lacking to her comfort. But the city
and Castello had suffered terribly in the protracted
struggle with France. The palace which had been
the pride of the Sforza Dukes was stripped of its
fairest treasures. The frescoes and tapestries were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
destroyed, the famous library was now in the castle of
Blois, and a great part of the walls had been thrown
down by French guns and allowed to crumble to
pieces. So dilapidated was the state of the building
that it was difficult to find habitable rooms for the
Duchess and her suite.</p>

<p>On the 21st of December, ten days after Christina's
arrival, she was forced to address a request to the
chief magistrate, Lodovico Pellizone, begging that
her bedroom might be supplied with a wooden ceiling,
as the room was lofty and bitterly cold in this winter
season. Pellizone wrote without delay to the Governor
of Milan, but received no reply, and on New Year's
Day Montmorency himself wrote to remind the
Cardinal of the Duchess's request, urging that the
work might be done without delay, and putting in
a plea for a better provision of mattresses to accommodate
the members of her household. Still no
redress was obtained, and at length the Captain of
the Archers took the law into his own hands, and sent
for carpenters to panel the Duchess's bedroom.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
But in spite of these drawbacks, in spite of the
wind that whistled through the long corridors and
the comfortless air of the empty halls, Christina's
health and spirits were excellent. Her spirits quickly
recovered their natural buoyancy in these new surroundings,
her eyes shone with the old brightness,
and the sound of merry laughter was once more
heard in the spacious halls and desolate gardens.
On the 3rd of January, only two days after Montmorency
addressed his fruitless remonstrance to the
Viceroy, Christina herself wrote a letter to the same
illustrious personage in a very different strain. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>had, it appears, seen a very handsome white horse in
the hostelry of the Fountain in Pavia, and was seized
with a passionate desire to have the palfrey for her
own use. So she wrote in the most persuasive
language to her good Father the Cardinal, begging
his leave to buy the horse, which she is convinced
will suit her exactly. But, since she fears that her
monthly allowance will not suffice to defray the cost,
she begs His Eminence to advance the necessary sum,
and charge it to the extraordinary expenses for which
she is not responsible. This letter, written in her
large round hand, was sent to Milan by one of the
Duchess's lackeys, with the words "Cito, cito" on
the cover, and an urgent plea for an immediate
answer.<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The kindly old Cardinal, who had a soft
side for the youthful Princess, could hardly refuse
so pressing a request, and Christina probably bought
the white horse, and had the pleasure of mounting it
when she rode out to visit the friars of the Certosa
or hunted in their park.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1537</span>] THE EMPEROR'S SERVANT</div>

<p>She had another good friend and devoted servant
in the Sieur de Courri&egrave;res&mdash;Monsignor di Corea, as he
was called in Italy. This gallant gentleman had
grown up in close intimacy with the Emperor from his
boyhood. He accompanied Charles to Spain as cupbearer,
and was appointed Captain of the Archers'
Guard on attaining his majority. In 1535 he followed
his master to Africa at the head of a chosen band of
archers, fifty of whom remained with him as an escort
for the Duchess. By Charles's orders, he sent constant
reports to His Majesty from Pavia. The correspondence
fills a whole volume, and is extremely interesting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>if only because it shows the familiarity with which
the great Emperor treated his old servant, and the
freedom which Montmorency allowed himself in addressing
his master.</p>

<p>On the 15th of February, Charles wrote from
Valladolid, thanking De Courri&egrave;res cordially for the
services which he had rendered the Duchess, approving
highly of her residence at Pavia, and promising
to pay for the maintenance of his archers. He
alludes pleasantly to Montmorency's meeting with
another of his confidential servants, Simonet, whom
he had left at Milan.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Simonet was right to put off his return to
Flanders until the worst rigours of winter were over,
and was fortunate in meeting you, for old folks of the
same country are very glad to meet in foreign lands,
even if they are not natives of Brabant. Farewell,
<i>cher et f&eacute;al</i>, for the present, and God have you in His
holy keeping!"</p></div>

<p>Five weeks later he wrote again, expressing his
satisfaction at hearing of his dear niece's health and
happiness, and saying how entirely he trusted Montmorency
to provide for her comfort.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"At the same time," he continued, "we cannot
help feeling, both with regard to the Duchess's
widowed condition and the troubled state of Italy,
that she would be better with our sister, the Queen
of Hungary, in our own country, <i>par-de&ccedil;a</i>, where
some suitable marriage might be found for her.
Accordingly we have written to our sister on the
subject, and desired Cardinal Caracciolo to make all
needful preparation for her journey. You had better
see that she has a proper escort and all else that is
necessary to her comfort, without making these things
public, until we hear from our sister."<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary on her part was most anxious for her niece's
return, and lost no time in letting Charles know how
impatiently she expected her. But, with characteristic
dilatoriness, the Imperial Council, which met at
Monzone on the 2nd of June, pronounced that it was
highly expedient for the Widow of Milan to go to
Flanders, but that the Queen's wishes must first of
all be consulted.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Meanwhile Count Massimiliano
Stampa returned from Spain with instructions from
the Emperor to make arrangements for the Duchess's
journey with the Cardinal and Montmorency, and
Charles wrote again to beg the Captain to start without
delay. But this, as Montmorency replied, was
not so easy. Three months' pay was due to his men,
and in his penniless condition it was hard to provide
them with food or their horses with fodder.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I will do my utmost, Sire," he wrote on the 15th
of June, "but some things are impossible. As I told
you when you left me at Genoa, six months' wages
were due to me, and I can only beg you to have pity
on your poor Captain; for we are in sore straits, and
you alone can help us, for, as the Scripture saith,
<i>Tua est potentia</i>."</p></div>

<p>At the same time, like the brave soldier that he
was, the writer cannot refrain from expressing his
joy at the good news of the capture of S. Pol, which
had just arrived from Flanders.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1537</span>] CAPTAIN OF THE ARCHERS</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Sire, I hear grand news from S. Pol, and am sure,
when you return to your Low Countries, you will find
that the Queen has been very vigilant in charge of
your affairs, and will be welcomed by very humble
and loyal subjects. But you will have something to
say to the citizens of Ghent, for I fear those gentlemen
are not as wise as they might be. Sire, I hear that,
after the surrender of Hesdin, your sister the Queen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>of France came to the camp in rich attire, with a
number of ladies all in white. Such insolence cannot
last long, as S. Pol&mdash;both the town and the Apostle&mdash;bear
witness. I hear that Madame the new Duchesse
d'&Eacute;tampes was nowhere. <i>Sic transit gloria mundi.</i>
All this Latin is to show Your Majesty that I have not
wasted my time in Pavia, any more than Don Beltrami
did at Louvain. Once more I beg you to have pity
on <i>La Chr&eacute;tiennete</i>, who needs your help more than
ever."</p></div>

<p>But the summer months went by, and still no orders
and no money came from Spain. Pavia became
unhealthy, and the Duchess and all the members of
her household fell ill of fever.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Hardly one has escaped," wrote Montmorency
on the 22nd of August, "but now, thank God, my
Lady has recovered, and I am trying to raise money
to carry out your orders, although I fear my purse is
not long enough to feed my poor archers."<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a></p></div>

<p>A month later the Captain went to Milan to expedite
matters, but as yet could hear nothing from Spain,
and on his return to Pavia early in October, he addressed
long remonstrances both to Charles and
Granvelle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Sire," wrote the irate Captain, "I have been
ordered to take my Lady Duchess to Flanders, but
not a word has been said as to the route that I am to
take. Since it is your pleasure, it shall be done; but
if any harm comes to her in Germany, seeing the poor
escort we shall have, who will be to blame? My
fear is that, as we pass through the duchy of W&uuml;rtemberg,
the Duke's son may fall upon us with his
<i>Landsknechten</i>, and my Lady would certainly not
be a bad match for him! Your Majesty has not
given me a single letter or warrant for the journey,
and has not written me a word. And when I get
<i>par-de&ccedil;a</i>, I know not what I am to do or say. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>Lady, too, is much surprised not to have received a
letter from Your Majesty before her departure, but
of this, of course, I have no right to speak."</p></div>

<p>In a postscript he adds that he has raised 500 gold
crowns, and given each of his men 10 crowns to buy
new saddles, as they hope to start on the 15th of
October. He ends by humbly reminding His Majesty
that he is growing old, and is almost fifty, and that
if he does not soon take a wife it will be too late.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"All this coming and going ages a man, and before
long I shall be as wrinkled as the rest. So when I
reach the Queen, I hope some little token of honour
may be given me, that men may see Your Majesty
has not wholly forgotten me. And you will, I hope,
tell me what I am to do when I have taken Her
Excellency to Flanders, as I have written to Granvelle
repeatedly, and had no answer, but suppose he is busy
with great affairs. And I pray that all prosperity may
attend Your Majesty, and that this year, which has
begun so well, may end by seeing you back in
Piedmont."<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1537</span>] CHRISTINA'S DEPARTURE</div>

<p>On the 14th of October Christina herself wrote to
inform the Emperor of her intended departure, and
of the good order of her affairs, thanks to the Cardinal
and Seigneur de Courri&egrave;res. "We hope to start to-morrow,
and travel by way of Mantua and Trent, and
through Germany, taking whichever seems to be the
shortest and safest route." There had, it appears,
been much discussion over the revenues assigned
to the Duchess as her dower, and in the end she
was deprived of the town and Castello of Vigevano,
which the Duke had left her by his will. But by the
terms of her marriage contract she remained absolute
mistress of the city of Tortona, and informed the
Emperor that, acting on the advice of the Cardinal, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Lady of Tortona, she had appointed a certain Gabriele
Panigarola to be Governor of the town, and begged his
approval. At the same time she sent her uncle a
memorial, drawn up by Montmorency, explaining
that, since she had not received the arrears of her
dowry, she was not able to pay her servants, and
had been forced to contract many debts at Pavia,
and to spend money on the repair of the rooms which
she occupied in the Castello.</p>

<p>Many last requests were addressed to the Duchess
by the poor and needy whom she had befriended, and
from her own servants, who with one voice begged to
be allowed to follow her to Flanders. One of the
most pressing came from an old Milanese couple,
whose son, Niccol&ograve; Belloni, was Christina's secretary,
and at their earnest prayer she decided to allow the
young man to remain in her service as one of the four
Italians who accompanied her to Flanders by the
Emperor's orders. And the last letter which the
Duchess wrote to the Cardinal, on the eve of her
departure, was to plead for a community of noble
ladies in Pavia who were reduced to dire poverty owing
to the late wars, and begged humbly for a remission
of taxes.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> During the ten months which she had spent
at Pavia the young Duchess had made herself beloved
by all classes of people, and her departure was lamented
by the whole city.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1537</span>] "EN VOYAGE"</div>

<p>On the 15th of October Christina and her suite left
Pavia, and started on their long-deferred journey to
Flanders. When she first set foot in Italy as a bride,
three and a half years before, the Lombard plains
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>were in the first flush of spring, roses and myrtles
were breaking into bloom, and the flowers sprang up
under her feet. Now the autumn rains fell in such
torrents that Cardinal Caracciolo was seriously
alarmed, and wrote to Benedetto da Corte and
Monsignore di Corea, asking if it might not be well
to delay their departure. The first idea had been to
go from Pavia to Cremona in a single day, but the bad
roads and swollen rivers increased the difficulties of
travel, and the Cardinal wrote to implore Messer
Benedetto and Corea not to undertake such long
journeys, lest the Duchess should be overtired. So
the party only rode as far as Codogno, the castle of
Count Gaspare Trivulzio, where he and his beautiful
wife, Deianira, received them joyfully, and entertained
them "as magnificently as if they had been invited
to a wedding." Christina's lady-in-waiting, the
Princess of Macedonia, rejoiced to be under her
daughter's roof, and Benedetto da Corte wrote to
tell the Cardinal that nothing could exceed the
splendour and hospitality of Count Gaspare's reception.
On the 18th the travellers rode along the
plains flooded by the swollen Po till they reached
Cremona, the dower city of Bianca Visconti, where
she had been married to the great Condottiere Francesco
Sforza, and which had clung with unswerving
loyalty to the fortunes of his house. Here the
Castellan came out to meet the Duchess, at the head
of the chief citizens, and escorted her to the Castello
under the shadow of the famous Torrazza, where she
and all her suite found the best of cheer. The next
morning the travellers resumed their way, and crossed
the rushing Oglio, under the castle of the Gonzagas of
Bozzolo, and rode along the green meadows by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Castiglione's country home, where his aged mother
was still living. The great courtier's name was
familiar to all Charles V.'s servants, and Montmorency,
who had known him in Spain, may have paused to
look at the fair sepulchral chapel which Giulio
Romano had lately reared in the pilgrimage church
of S. Maria delle Grazie. At Mantua another splendid
welcome awaited Christina. The Gonzaga Princes
never forgot their close relationship to the Sforzas,
and while the reigning Duchess welcomed the Princess
of Macedonia as a kinswoman, the old Marchesana,
Isabella, rejoiced to embrace her nephew's wife, and
looked with affection on this youthful Duchess who
bore the same title as her long-lost Beatrice.</p>

<p>The next morning Benedetto da Corte sent the Cardinal
a glowing account of their journey, which, in
spite of the weather, had been one triumphal progress:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Reverendissimo</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"Her Excellency arrived safely here at Mantua
yesterday with all her company, horses, and carriages,
and was received most royally, as has, indeed, been
the case in every place where we have halted on our
way. Her whole household has been entertained
with the best fare, and with little damage to our
purses.... The kindness with which we have been
received has made these perpetual rains tolerable.
We are quite accustomed to them, and shall not be
afraid of the next tempest! We are resting here on
this sixth day of our journey at the entreaty of these
illustrious Princes. On Sunday, please God, we shall
reach Verona, and I have sent to ask the Governor
to prepare convenient lodgings for Her Excellency.
His Reverence the Cardinal of Trent has sent a
messenger here to-night to inquire how many we
number, and so we go on gaily from stage to stage.
Once we have reached Trent, we shall seem to be in
sight of the Rhine, and can pursue our way at less
peril to our lives, and, let us hope, to the greater<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
advantage of His Majesty's service. I kiss Your
Reverence's hand, and so also does Monsignore di
Corea.</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 21em;">"<span class="smcap">Benedetto da Corte.</span></span><br />
"Mantova, October 20."<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a><br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1537</span>] THE CARDINAL OF TRENT</div>

<p>The Cardinal's worst anxieties were relieved by
the receipt of Benedetto's letter, and he sent a reply
to the Castle of Trent thanking him and Monsignore
di Corea for their trouble, and expressing great
satisfaction to hear of their prosperous journey. The
travellers now turned their steps northwards, and,
after spending a night in the city of the Scaligeri,
followed the Adige through the rocky defile known as
La Chiusa di Verona. As they passed through the
fortified gates at the farther end of the ravine, a
salute from the guns made them aware that they had
entered Austrian territory. A few miles farther they
were met by the Cardinal-Bishop, Bernhard von Cl&egrave;s,
who had ridden out with a great train to welcome
the Duchess. A strong Imperialist no less than
an active reformer, Bernhard von Cl&egrave;s had been
raised to the cardinalate at Charles's coronation, and
was now Vice-Chancellor of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> He had
lately received a visit from Christina's uncle, King
Ferdinand, and his wife, Anna, who honoured his
niece's wedding with their presence, and the sumptuous
rooms which they had occupied were now
placed at Christina's disposal. "Nothing was lacking,"
wrote Benedetto da Corte, "which could please
the eye or delight the mind." The splendour of the
episcopal palace and the open-handed liberality of
the Cardinal made a great impression on Montmorency,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>who wrote himself to tell the Cardinal how
well Madama had borne the journey.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I cannot tell you," he adds, "how splendidly
Monsignor Reverendissimo has received the Duchess,
and how sumptuously he has feasted us. Here we
mean to rest all to-day, and to-morrow we will pursue
our journey with the utmost diligence."</p></div>

<p>But so pressing was the Cardinal, and so luxurious
were the quarters provided for them, that the
travellers remained at Trent several days, and only
resumed their journey on the 27th of October.</p>

<p>The most arduous part of the way now lay before
them, and Benedetto describes how they harnessed
the mules to the chariot in order that the Duchess
and her ladies might drive across the Brenner Pass,
at least as far as Innsbruck. Montmorency was in
some doubt as to the route which the Duchess had
better take through Germany, but, much to his
satisfaction, he found the long-expected letter from
the Emperor awaiting him at Innsbruck. It was
written from Monzone on the last day of October, a
fortnight after Christina had left Pavia. Charles put
the blame of his delay on the Queen of Hungary's
shoulders, and, since it was too late to wait for her
directions, bade him consult the Cardinal of Trent
as to their future journey.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If you have already left Trent, you had better go
on either by road or else by the Rhine. If you are at
Innsbruck, you can take advice from the King our
brother or from Dr. Matthias Held"&mdash;one of Ferdinand's
most trusted German Councillors&mdash;"and choose
whichever route they consider the safest. If you have
received no letters from the Queen, you had better
send a messenger to Flanders, and we will inform you
as soon as we know her pleasure regarding our niece's
future plans."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>In conclusion the Emperor tells Montmorency that
he is sending the letters patent for which he asked,
although they are hardly necessary, and has already
told the Queen to refund all the expenses which he
has incurred, and to be mindful of his great and long
services.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>The travellers spent some time at Innsbruck in
the ancient castle which is still adorned with the
Sforza arms, and Christina saw the superb monument
erected by her great-grandfather Maximilian in the
church hard by. Ferdinand and his wife and daughters
were in Vienna, but the route which Montmorency
chose was that followed by most travellers, along the
Lake of Constance and down the Rhine to Spires.
From the first Christina had been very anxious to visit
her sister Dorothea on her journey north, and she
succeeded in obtaining her uncle's consent to this
arrangement. The two Princesses had not met since
Christina left Brussels in the spring of 1534, and
Dorothea was no less impatient to see her sister.
Even before the travellers reached Trent, they met
two Genoese merchants, who told Montmorency that
on their way through Germany they had seen the
Count Palatine Frederic and Madama la Principessa,
his wife, with a great company, on their way to
Heidelberg to await the Duchess's coming. When,
in November, the travellers at length reached Heidelberg,
they found themselves impatiently expected,
and Christina received the warmest welcome from the
Elector Palatine and his family.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1537</span>] AT HOME AGAIN</div>

<p>Festivities such as Frederic and Dorothea took
delight in&mdash;jousting, banquets, and dances&mdash;followed
each other in rapid succession, and the castle blazed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>with innumerable torches through the winter nights.
It was a great change from the funereal blackness of
the Castello of Milan and the desolate halls of Pavia,
and the young Duchess enjoyed it to the full. The
days sped by all too quickly, and so happy were the
sisters in each other's company that the Elector
invited Christina to stay over Christmas. The young
Duchess accepted the proposal gleefully, and all were
preparing to spend a joyous festival, when Montmorency
received peremptory orders from the Queen-Regent
to bring her niece forthwith to Flanders.
After this no delays were possible. The sisters parted
sadly from each other, and the travellers once more
took boat and sailed down the Rhine to Cologne.</p>

<p>From here it was an easy journey to Aix-la-Chapelle,
and through the friendly State of Cleves to
Maestricht, and thence to Louvain and Brussels. On
the 8th of December Christina set foot once more
in the ancient palace of the Dukes of Brabant, and
was clasped in her aunt's arms. Ten days afterwards
she wrote a letter to inform the Emperor of her safe
arrival, and of "the good and loving welcome" which
she had received from "Madame my aunt." She
begged His Majesty to keep her still in his remembrance,
and signed herself, "Your humble niece,
Chr&eacute;tienne."<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p>She was at home once more among her own people,
and all the strange sights and scenes, all the wonderful
experiences which she had known, in these four eventful
years, seemed to fade away like a dream. But
she had left Flanders a child, and she came back a
woman.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<h3>IV.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1537</span>] THE CLEVES MARRIAGE</div>

<p>Christina's return was impatiently awaited at
Brussels. The courtiers who remembered her mother,
and had known her as a child, were eager to see
the young Duchess, whose courage and wisdom
had been shown in such trying circumstances. All
through the summer her coming had been expected,
and the Regent was seriously annoyed at the prolonged
delays which had hindered her niece's departure
from Milan. Her heart yearned over the child
from whom she had parted with so much reluctance.
More than this, she had in her mind's eye a
second husband ready for the young Duchess. This
was William, the only son and heir of the reigning
Duke of Cleves. A handsome and well-educated
young man of twenty-two, the young Duke had not yet
developed that fatal weakness of purpose which
proved his bane, and was to all appearances an excellent
match for the Emperor's niece. The political
advantages of the union were obvious. Duke John had
married the heiress of J&uuml;lich and Bergh, and reigned
over three rich and peaceful provinces on the Lower
Rhine. He had always been on friendly terms with the
Emperor, and when, a few months after the Duke of
Milan's death, he asked for the young widow's hand on
behalf of his son, Mary welcomed these advances gladly,
and hastened to communicate them to the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
At first Charles replied coolly that, if the marriage
with Angoul&ecirc;me could not be arranged, the proposals
made by the King of Scotland or Cleves might be
entertained. In October, 1536, Mary sent a confidential
messenger, La Tiloye, to Genoa to learn the Emperor's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>pleasure in the matter, but nothing further was done.
After the fresh outbreak of war in 1537, and the
invasion of Artois by the French, Charles became
more alive to the importance of the question, and
wrote to his sister from Spain, saying that he had
ordered the Widow of Milan to go to the Low Countries,
and hoped she would proceed at once to the conclusion
of the marriage with Cleves.<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>At that moment all Mary's energies were absorbed
in the struggle with France. She herself went to
Lille to superintend military operations, and appeared
on horseback in the trenches before Th&eacute;rouenne,
where her courage excited the admiration of
John Hutton, the English Ambassador. "Let the
King but tarry fifteen days," she exclaimed, "and
I will show him what God may strengthen a woman
to do!" But, in spite of these brave words, Mary,
as Hutton soon discovered, was sincerely desirous
to end the war. "The Queen's anxiety for peace,"
he wrote home, "is as great as her ardour in war."<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
She knew the straits to which the Emperor was
reduced and the exhaustion of the Treasury. "The
poverty of this country is so great," she wrote to
Charles on the 9th of June, "that it is impossible to
provide necessary funds for the war. We must have
peace, or we are lost."<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Under these circumstances she
lent a willing ear to her sister Queen Eleanor's advances,
and the two sisters had the satisfaction of arranging a
truce at Bomy, a village near Th&eacute;rouenne. The siege
of this city was raised, the French evacuated the towns
which they held, and on the 10th of September peace
was ratified by the Emperor at Monzone.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1538</span>] THE SUCCESSION OF GUELDERS</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary felt that she could once more breathe freely.
She lost no time in renewing negotiations with the
Duke of Cleves, and the proposed marriage became
the talk of the Court. "The Queen," wrote Hutton,
on the 2nd of September, from Bruges, where Mary
was hunting after her wont and spending all day in
the saddle, "looketh daily for the Duchess of Milan,
who shall be married to the Duke of Cleves's son and
heir."<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> A month later the Cleves Envoys arrived at
Brussels, and, after repeated interviews with the
Queen and her Council, returned, well satisfied, to
obtain their master's consent to the terms of the contract.
The news spread rapidly, and was reported
by Ambassadors from Spain and Germany, from Rome
and Paris, with the same unanimity. Suddenly an
unexpected event altered the face of affairs. Charles
of Egmont, the fiery old Duke of Guelders, who had
for many years been the Emperor's bitter enemy, fell
ill, and, feeling his end to be near, summoned the
Estates of his realm to choose a successor. Since he
had no issue, his own wish was to leave his States
to the French King; but his subjects positively refused
to be handed over to a foreign Power, and chose
the young Duke William of Cleves, who hastened to
visit Nimeguen, where he was acclaimed by his future
subjects. This was a clear breach of faith, since, by
the treaty concluded a year before with the Emperor,
Guelders was to pass into his hands at Charles of
Egmont's death, and the ancient rights to the duchy
which the House of Cleves formerly claimed had
been already sold to the Dukes of Burgundy.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Mary's
indignation was great. She wrote angrily to tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>William of Cleves that Guelders was the property of
the Emperor, and that if he persevered in his pretensions
all idea of his marriage to her niece must be
abandoned. The young Duke returned a courteous
answer, saying that nothing could be farther from
his thoughts than a breach of loyalty to the Emperor,
and professing the utmost anxiety for the marriage.
At the same time the old Duke's action excited
great annoyance in Lorraine, where his nephew, the
reigning Duke Anthony, claimed to be heir to Guelders,
through his mother, Philippa of Egmont. An
attempt to pacify him by reviving a former marriage
contract between his son Francis and the Duke of
Cleves's daughter Anne met with no encouragement,
and Ambassadors were sent to Guelders to enter a
protest on the Duke of Lorraine's behalf.<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> But
Charles of Egmont turned a deaf ear to all remonstrances,
and on the 27th of January, 1538, William
of Cleves received the homage of the States of Guelders,
and was publicly recognized as the old Duke's successor.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when Christina reached
Brussels on the 8th of December, 1537. Her faithful
guardian, Montmorency, alludes to the Cleves marriage
in the following letter, which he addressed to
Cardinal Caracciolo on the 5th of January, 1538:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I wrote last from Trent on the 26th of October,
and since then have received several letters from you,
and have duly informed the Duchess of their contents.
She is very grateful for your kindness regarding her
affairs, and begs you not to relax your efforts....
As to Madama's marriage with Cleves, as far as I can
learn, it will not take place, because the Duke has
quarrelled with Lorraine, and Guelders is interfering.
Negotiations, however, are not yet broken off."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>
<p>Three months later he referred to the matter again
in another letter, and this time expressed his conviction
that the marriage would never take place.<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>Montmorency's own claims had not been forgotten.
Soon after his return he married a lady of the Lannoy
family, and was appointed Bailiff of Alost. Both
Charles and Mary treated him with marked favour,
and employed him on important diplomatic missions.
But he still held an honorary post in the Duchess's
household, and never ceased to be her devoted
servant.</p>

<p>During the winter Hutton alluded repeatedly to
the affair of Cleves in his letters to Cromwell, saying
that the Duke had been recognized by the Communes
of Guelders as their liege lord, and that the Queen
quite refused to let him wed the Duchess, although
he was still eager for the alliance. All sorts of wild
rumours were flying about, and an Italian merchant
at Antwerp wrote to London that young Cleves was
about to marry the daughter of Lorraine, with
Guelders as her dowry. But on the 25th of January
Hutton reported that the Queen had sent Nassau and
De Praet to Duke William, to break off marriage
negotiations and clear her of all former promises.<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1538</span>] THE PALACE OF BRABANT</div>

<p>Christina herself was the person least concerned in
these rumours. Princes and Ministers might wrangle
as they chose; they could not destroy the happiness of
being in her old home, surrounded by familiar faces.
The sound of the French tongue and the carillon
in the towers were music in her ears. Three things
above all impressed Italian travellers, like Guicciardini
and Beatis, who came to the Low Countries for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>the first time&mdash;the cleanliness of the streets and
houses, the green pastures with their herds of black
and white cows, and the beautiful church bells. These
were all delightful to the young Duchess, who had been
so long absent from her old home. The city of Brussels,
with its fine houses and noble churches, its famous
h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, and 350 fountains, was a pleasant town
to live in. And the Palace of Brabant itself was a
wonderful place. There was the great hall, with its lofty
pointed arches, and priceless Burgundian tapestries,
and the golden suns and silver moons recently brought
back from the New World by Cortes, the conqueror
of Mexico.</p>

<p>The Queen gave Christina a suite of rooms close to
her own, looking out on the glossy leaves and interwoven
boughs of the labyrinth, and the gardens beyond,
which Albert D&uuml;rer had called an earthly
paradise, and which the Cardinal of Aragon's secretary
pronounced to be as beautiful as any in Italy.<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a>
Here the young Duchess lived with her ladies and
household, presided over by Benedetto da Corte and
Niccol&ograve; Belloni. Every morning she attended Mass
in the Court chapel, and dined and spent the evenings
with the Queen. On fine days, when Mary
could spare time from public affairs, they rode out
together and hunted the deer in the park, or took longer
expeditions in the Forest of Soignies. As fearless and
almost as untiring a rider as her aunt, Christina was
quite at home in the saddle, and followed the Queen's
example of riding with her foot in the stirrup, an
accomplishment which was new in those days, and
excited Brant&ocirc;me's admiration.<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>The following Christmas was celebrated with great
festivity at Brussels. The war was over, and the
presence of a youthful Princess gave new charm to
Court functions. Wherever Christina went she made
herself beloved. Her quick wit and frank enjoyment
of simple pleasures charmed everyone. Although in
public she still wore heavy mourning robes after the
Italian fashion, and hid away her bright chestnut
locks under a black hood, in the evening, by her
aunt's desire, she laid aside her weeds, and appeared
clad in rich brocades and glittering jewels. Then she
conversed freely with her aunt's ladies and with the
foreign Ambassadors, or played cards with the few
great nobles who were admitted to the Queen's
private circle&mdash;Henry, Count of Nassau, the proudest
and richest lord in Flanders; the Duke of Aerschot
and his wife, Anne de Croy, the heiress of the Princes
of Chimay; his sister, Madame de Berghen; Count
B&uuml;ren; and a few others.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1538</span>] A PERFECT KNIGHT</div>

<p>Among them was one whom the young Duchess
regarded with especial interest. This was the hero
of S. Pol, Ren&eacute;, Prince of Orange. The only son and
heir of the great House of Nassau, Ren&eacute; had inherited
the principality of Orange, in the South of France,
from his uncle Philibert of Ch&acirc;lons, the Imperialist
leader who fell at the siege of Florence, and whose
sister Claude was Henry of Nassau's first wife. As
a child Ren&eacute; had been Prince John of Denmark's
favourite playmate, and Christina had not forgotten
her brother's old friend. Now he had grown up a
handsome and chivalrous Prince, skilled in all knightly
exercises. He had won his first laurels in the recent
campaign, and was the foremost of the valiant band
which surprised the citadel of S. Pol. The Queen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
honoured him with her especial favour, and, as the
Nassau house stood close to the palace, the young
Prince was often in her company. When, on Shrove
Sunday, a grand tournament was held at Court, one
troop, clad in blue, was led by Count B&uuml;ren's eldest
son, Floris d'Egmont; and the other by Ren&eacute;, wearing
the orange colours of his house, with the proud motto,
<i>Je maintiendrai</i>. Christina looked down from her
place at the Queen's side on the lists where the
gallant Prince challenged all comers, and it was from
her hand that the victor received the prize. Neither
of them ever forgot that carnival.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<h2>BOOK VI<br />

THE COURTSHIP OF HENRY VIII.<br />

1537-1539</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The Widow of Milan's fate still hung in the balance.
While Mary of Hungary had not yet lost all hope of
marrying her to the Duke of Cleves, and Queen
Eleanor was no less anxious to see her the wife of a
French Prince, fresh proposals reached Brussels from
an unexpected quarter. This new suitor was none
other than the Emperor's <i>bel oncle</i>, King Henry of England.
This monarch, who had openly defied the laws
of the Church, and after divorcing Charles's aunt, had
pronounced Queen Katherine's daughter to be illegitimate,
could hardly expect to find favour in the eyes of
the Regent. Mary's own opinion of Henry's character
is frankly given in a very interesting letter which she
wrote to her brother Ferdinand in May, 1536, when the
King of England had sent Anne Boleyn to the block
and made Jane Seymour his third wife.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1536</span>] HENRY VIII. AND HIS WIVES</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I hope," she wrote, "that the English will not
do us much harm now we are rid of the King's mistress,
who was a good Frenchwoman, and whom, as
you have no doubt heard, he has beheaded; and since
no one skilful enough to do the deed could be found
among his own subjects, he sent for the executioner
of S. Omer, in order that a Frenchman should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>the minister of his vengeance. I hear that he has
married another lady, who is said to be a good Imperialist,
although I do not know if she will remain
so much longer. He is said to have taken a fancy
to her before the last one's death, which, coupled
with the fact that neither the poor woman nor any
of those who were beheaded with her, saving one
miserable musician, could be brought to acknowledge
her guilt, naturally makes people suspect that he
invented this pretext in order to get rid of her....
It is to be hoped&mdash;if one can hope anything from such
a man&mdash;that when he is tired of this wife he will
find some better way of getting rid of her. Women,
I think, would hardly be pleased if such customs
became general, and with good reason; and although
I have no wish to expose myself to similar risks, yet,
as I belong to the feminine sex, I, too, will pray that
God may preserve us from such perils."<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p></div>

<p>But whatever Mary's private opinions were, political
reasons compelled her to preserve a friendly demeanour
towards King Henry. The English alliance
was of the utmost importance to the trade of the
Netherlands, and the enmity of France made it essential
to secure Henry's neutrality, if not his active
help. The death of Queen Katherine, as Cromwell
wrote, had removed "the onelie matter of unkindness"
between the two monarchs, and was soon followed
by more friendly communications. When the
news of Prince Edward's birth reached Spain, the
Emperor held a long conversation with Sir Thomas
Wyatt, the poet and scholar, who had been sent to
the Imperial Court early in 1537. He expressed
great pleasure at the news, laughing and talking
pleasantly, inquiring after the size and goodliness of
the child, and ended by saying frankly that he
approved of the King's recent marriage as much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
he had always disliked his union with Anne Boleyn.<a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
These last remarks must have fallen strangely on the
ears of Wyatt, whose old intimacy with the hapless
Queen had nearly cost him his life, and whose death
he lamented in some of his sweetest verse. But he
was too good a courtier not to repeat them in his letters
to Cromwell and the King. The news of the Prince's
birth was shortly followed by that of the Queen's
death, which took place at Hampton Court on the
24th of October.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Divine Providence," said the royal widower,
"has mingled my joy for the son which it has pleased
God to give me with the bitterness of the death of
her who brought me this happiness."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1537</span>] MARIE DE GUISE</div>

<p>Cromwell wrote to inform Lord William Howard,
the special Envoy who had taken the news of the
Prince's birth to France, of Her Grace's death, and
in the same letter desired him to bring back particulars
of two French ladies who had been recommended
as suitable successors to the late Queen,
since His Majesty, "moved by tender zeal for his
subjects," had already resolved to marry again. One
of these was King Francis's plain but accomplished
daughter Margaret, who eventually married the Duke
of Savoy, although Cromwell, knowing his master's
tastes, remarked that, from what he heard, he
"did not think she would be the meetest."<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> The
other was Mary, Duchess of Longueville, the eldest
daughter of Claude de Guise, brother of the Duke of
Lorraine. The charms of this young widow were
renowned at the French Court, and the English
Ambassador's reports of her modesty and beauty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>inspired Henry with an ardent wish to make her his
wife. Even before Jane Seymour was in her grave,
he attacked the French Ambassador, Castillon, on the
subject, and suggested that both these Princesses,
and any other ladies whom the King of France could
recommend, might be sent to meet him at Calais.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

<p>Francis, who was more gallant in his relations with
women than his brother of England, laughed long and
loudly when this message reached him, and sent
Castillon word that royal Princesses could not be
trotted out like hackney horses for hire! He quite
declined to allow his daughter to enter the lists; and
as for Madame de Longueville, whom the King was
pleased to honour with his suit, she was already
promised to his son-in-law, the King of Scots. This
fickle monarch, who had courted Dorothea and Christina
by turn, and finally married Madeleine de Valois,
had lost his young wife at the end of six months,
and was already in search of another. At the same
time Francis sent his royal brother word that he
should count it a great honour if he could find a
bride in his realm, and that any other lady in France
was at his command.<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> But Henry was not accustomed
to have his wishes thwarted, and in December,
1537, he sent a gentleman of his chamber, Sir Peter
Mewtas, on a secret mission to Joinville, the Duke
of Guise's castle on the borders of Lorraine, to wait
on Madame de Longueville, and find out if her word
was already pledged. Both Madame de Longueville
and her clever mother, Antoinette de Bourbon, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>turned
evasive answers, saying that the Duke of
Guise had agreed to the marriage with King James,
but that his daughter's consent had never been given.
This reply encouraged Henry to persevere with his
suit, while Mewtas's description of the Duchess's
beauty, in Castillon's words, "set the tow on fire." He
complained that his brother had behaved shamefully
in preferring the beggarly King of Scots to him, and
was forcing the lady to marry James against her will.
In vain Castillon told him that Madame de Longueville
had been promised to the King of Scots before Queen
Jane's death, and that Francis could not break his
word without mortally offending his old ally and son-in-law.
Nothing daunted, Henry sent Mewtas again
to Joinville in February, 1538, to obtain Madame de
Longueville's portrait, and ask if she were still free.
This time his errand proved fruitless. The marriage
with the King of Scots was already concluded, and
the contract signed. Nevertheless, Henry still harped
on the same string. "Il revient toujours &agrave; ses
moutons," wrote Castillon, "et ne peut pas oublier
sa berg&egrave;re." "Truly he is a marvellous man!"<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Cromwell, who had no personal inclination
for the French alliance, was making inquiries in
other directions. Early in December, while Mewtas
was on his way to Joinville, the Lord Privy Seal wrote
privately to Hutton, desiring him to send him a list
of ladies in Flanders who would be suitable consorts
for the King. In a letter written on the 4th of December,
the Ambassador replied that he had little
knowledge of ladies, and feared he knew no one at
the Regent's Court "meet to be Queen of England."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1537</span>] A GOODLY PERSON</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The widow of Count Egmont," he wrote, "was
a fair woman of good report, and the Duke of Cleves
had a marriageable daughter, but he heard no great
praise of her person or beauty. There is," he added,
"the Duchess of Milan, whom I have not seen, but
who is reported to be a goodly personage of excellent
beauty."<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a></p></div>

<p>Five days later Hutton wrote again, to announce
the arrival of the Duchess, who entered Brussels on
the 8th, and was received by a great company of
honourable gentlemen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"She is, I am informed, of the age of sixteen years,
very high in stature for that age&mdash;higher, in fact,
than the Regent&mdash;and a goodly personage of competent
beauty, of favour excellent, soft of speech,
and very gentle in countenance. She weareth mourning
apparel, after the manner of Italy. The common
saying here is that she is both widow and maid. She
resembleth much one Mistress Skelton,<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> that sometime
waited in Court upon Queen Anne. She useth
most to speak French, albeit it is reported that she
can speak both Italian and High German."</p></div>

<p>The same evening Hutton added these further
details in a postscript addressed to Cromwell's secretary,
Thomas Wriothesley:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If it were God's pleasure and the King's, I would
there were some good alliance made betwixt His
Highness and the Emperor, and there is none in these
parts of personage, beauty, and birth, like unto the
Duchess of Milan. She is not so pure white as was
the late Queen, whose soul God pardon, but she hath
a singular good countenance, and when she chanceth
to smile, there appeareth two pits in her cheeks and
one in her chin, the which becometh her right excellently
well."<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>The honest Englishman's first impressions of Christina
were evidently very favourable. During the
next week he watched her carefully, and was much
struck by "the great majesty of her bearing and charm
of her manners." At the same time he expressed his
earnest conviction that, now peace was concluded
between the Emperor and the French King, a close
alliance between his own master and the Emperor
was the more necessary, and suggested that a marriage
between Henry and the Duchess, and another between
the Princess Mary and the Duke of Cleves,
would be very advantageous to both monarchs, who
would then have all Germany at their command.</p>

<p>Cromwell lost no time in placing these letters in
his master's hands. Hutton's account of the Duchess's
beauty and virtues made a profound impression
on the King, and, since Madame de Longueville was
beyond his reach, he determined to pay his addresses
to the Emperor's niece. With characteristic impetuosity,
he wrote to Wyatt on the 22nd of January,
saying that, as the Duchess of Milan's match with
the Duke of Cleves was broken off, he thought of
honouring her with an offer of marriage. This he
desired Wyatt to suggest as of himself, in conversation
with the Emperor and his Ministers, Granvelle
and Covos, giving them a friendly hint to make overtures
on behalf of the said Duchess.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1538</span>] KING HENRY'S SUIT</div>

<p>Strangely enough, two years before Charles had
himself proposed this alliance between his niece and
the King of England. In May, 1536, when he was
hurrying northwards to defend Savoy against the
French, the news of Anne Boleyn's fall reached him
at Vercelli. Without a moment's delay he wrote to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>Chapuys, his Ambassador in London, saying that,
since Henry, being of so amorous a complexion, was
sure to take another wife, and it was most important
that he should not marry in France, Chapuys might
propose his union with one of the Emperor's nieces,
either Queen Eleanor's daughter, the Infanta Maria
of Portugal, or the widowed Duchess of Milan, "a
beautiful young lady, very well brought up, and
with a rich dower." And then, as if a qualm had
seized him at the thought of sacrificing Christina to
a man of Henry's character, he added a postscript
desiring the Ambassador not to mention the Duchess
unless His Majesty should appear averse to the
other.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>By the time, however, that these letters reached
London, it was plain that the fickle monarch's affections
were already fixed on Jane Seymour, and
nothing more came of the Emperor's proposal until,
in January, 1538, Henry himself wrote to Wyatt.
Sir Thomas, who knew his royal master intimately,
hastened to approach the Emperor, and on the 2nd of
February Charles wrote from Barcelona to Chapuys,
saying that, although royal ladies ought by right to
be <i>sought</i>, not <i>offered</i>, in marriage, the King's language
was so frank and sincere that he was willing to
waive ceremony, and lend a favourable ear to his
brother's proposal. Before these letters reached the
Imperial Ambassador, he received a message from
Henry, saying that he wished to treat of his own
marriage with the Duchess of Milan, being convinced
that a Princess born and bred in Northern climes
would suit him far better than the Portuguese
Infanta. The next day Cromwell paid a visit to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Chapuys, and confirmed every word of the royal
message.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>On the eve of Valentine's Day Henry saw Castillon,
and told him in bitter tones that, if his master did not
choose to give him Madame de Longueville, he could
find plenty of better matches, and meant to marry
the Duchess of Milan and conclude a close alliance
with the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>On the same day the German reformer Melanchthon,
writing from Jena to a Lutheran friend, summed up
the situation neatly in the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Widow of Milan, daughter of Christian, the
captive King of Denmark, was brought to Germany
to wed the young Duke of Juliers. This is now
changed, for Juliers becomes heir to Guelders, against
the Emperor's will, and the girl is offered to the
Englishman, whom the Spaniards, aiming at universal
empire, would join to themselves against the Frenchmen
and us. There is grave matter for your consideration."<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p></div>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The ball was now set rolling, but, as Chapuys foretold,
there were many difficulties in the way. For the
moment, however, all went well. Henry sent Hutton
orders to watch the Duchess closely, and report on
all her words, deeds, and looks. In obedience to
these commands, the Ambassador hung about the
palace from early morning till late at night, was present
at supper and card parties, attended the Queen
out riding and hunting, and lost no opportunity
of entering into conversation with Christina herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1538</span>] HUTTON'S ADVANCES</div>

<p>One evening towards the end of February a page
brought him some letters from the Duchess's servant,
Gian Battista Ferrari, who had friends among the
Italian merchants in London, with a request that
the Ambassador would forward them by his courier.
The next morning, after Mass, when the Queen passed
into the Council-chamber, Hutton took advantage of
this opportunity to thank the Duchess most humbly
for allowing him to do her this small service. Christina
replied, with a gracious smile, that she would not have
ventured to give him this trouble, had she not been
as ready herself to do him any pleasure that lay in
her power.</p>

<p>It was stormy weather. For three days and nights
it had rained without ceasing, and courtiers and
ladies alike found the time hang heavy on their hands.
"This weather liketh not the Queen," remarked
Christina, who was standing by an open window
looking out on the park. "She is thereby penned up,
and cannot ride abroad to hunt." As she spoke, the
wind drove the rain with such violence into her face
that she was obliged to draw back farther into the
room, and Hutton, growing bolder, asked if it were
true that the Duchess herself loved hunting.
"Nothing better," replied Christina, laughing; and
she seemed as if she would gladly have prolonged the
conversation. But then two ancient gentlemen drew
near&mdash;"Master Bernadotte Court, her Grand Master,
who, next to Monsieur de Courri&egrave;res, is chief about
her and another"&mdash;and, with a parting bow, the
Duchess retired to her own rooms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"She speaketh French," adds Hutton in reporting
this interview to Cromwell, "and seemeth to be of
few words. And in her speaking she lispeth, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
doth nothing misbecome her. I cannot in anything
perceive but she should be of much soberness, very
wise, and no less gentle."<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a></p></div>

<p>Among the ladies who came to Court for the
Carnival f&ecirc;tes, Hutton found a friend in the
Duke of Aerschot's sister, Madame de Berghen, a
lively lady whom he had known in the town of
Berghen-op-Zoom, where he had spent much time as
Governor of the Merchant Adventurers. The Dutch
merchants in this city had presented him with a
house, an honour which the Ambassador appreciated
highly, although he complained that it led him into
great extravagance, and that the furniture, tapestries,
and pictures, necessary for its adornment, "plucked
the lining out of his purse, and left him as rich as a
newly-shorn sheep."<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1538</span>] "MR. HAUNCE"</div>

<p>One day Madame de Berghen saw Hutton in the
act of delivering a packet of letters which Wyatt had
forwarded from Barcelona to the Queen, and her
curiosity was excited by the warmth of Mary's thanks.
That evening she invited the English Ambassador to
dinner to meet her kinsman the Bishop of Li&eacute;ge, "a
goodly personage," remarks Hutton, "but a man of
little learning and less discretion, and, like most
Bishops in these parts, very unfit for his office."
When this secular ecclesiastic retired, the Lady
Marchioness, "whose tongue always wagged freely,"
asked Hutton if the letters which he had delivered to
the Queen came from England, and confessed that
she hoped they contained good news regarding the
Duchess of Milan, whose beauty, wisdom, and great
gentleness, she could not praise too highly. She told
him that he would have been amazed had he seen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>Christina gorgeously apparelled as she was the day
before, and confided to him that the Duchess was
having her portrait taken by the Court painter,
Bernard van Orley, and had promised to give it to
her. Hutton begged to be allowed to borrow the picture
in order to show it to his wife, and told Cromwell
that as soon as he could secure the portrait he would
send it to England. Accordingly, on the 9th of
March the Ambassador received the picture, which
Madame de Berghen begged him to accept as her gift,
and sent a servant to bear it without delay to the
Lord Privy Seal's house in St. James's. Late on the
following evening, much to the Ambassador's surprise,
a young Shropshire gentleman, named Mr.
Philip Hoby, who had lately entered Cromwell's service,
appeared at his lodgings, accompanied by the
King's painter, Master Hans Holbein. At this time
the German master was at the height of his reputation.
Since 1536, when he entered Henry's service as Court
painter, he had executed some of his finest portraits,
including the famous picture of the King in Whitehall
Palace, the superb portrait of Queen Jane, and that
of Cromwell himself, which is so marvellous a revelation
of character. Now the Lord Privy Seal sent him
across the Channel to take a sketch of the Duchess
of Milan, and bring it back with all possible despatch.</p>

<p>Hutton's first idea was to send a messenger to stop
the bearer of the Flemish portrait, fearing it might
give a wrong impression of the lady, "since it was
not so perfect as the cause required, and as the said
Mr. Haunce could make it." But his servant had
already sailed, and the Ambassador could only beg
Cromwell to await Master Hans's return before he
formed any opinion of the Duchess. The next morn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>ing
he waited on the Queen, and informed her how
the Lord Privy Seal, having received secret overtures
from the Imperial Ambassador for a marriage
between the King's Majesty and Her Grace of Milan,
thought the best way to approach the King was to
show him a portrait of the Duchess.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"And forasmuch as his lordship heard great
commendation of the form, beauty, wisdom, and
other virtuous qualities, with which God had endowed
the Duchess, he could perceive no means more
meet for the advancement of the same than to procure
her perfect picture, for which he had sent a
man very excellent in the making of physiognomies."</p></div>

<p>After long and elaborate explanation, Hutton asked
humbly if his lordship's servant might salute the
Duchess, and beg her to appoint a time and place for
the painter to accomplish his task.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1538</span>] HOLBEIN'S PORTRAIT</div>

<p>Mary was evidently greatly surprised to hear of
the Ambassador's errand. She started from her
chair in amazement, but, quickly recovering composure,
she sat down again, and listened attentively
till Hutton had done speaking. Then she
thanked him and Lord Cromwell for their good-will
to the Emperor, and said that she had no objection
to grant his request, and that he should see the
Duchess herself. With these few words she rose
and passed into the Council-chamber. Presently
Christina entered the room, attended by two ladies.
She listened graciously to Hutton's message, expressed
her gratitude to Lord Cromwell for his kind
intentions, and sent Benedetto da Corte back with
him to meet the English gentleman. Fortunately,
Philip Hoby was a pleasant and cultivated young
man who could speak Italian fluently. He conversed
for some time with Messer Benedetto, much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
to Hutton's envy and admiration, and at two o'clock
that afternoon was conducted by him into the
presence of the Duchess.</p>

<p>Cromwell had given Hoby minute instructions as
to his behaviour on this occasion, and had composed
a long and elaborate speech which he was to deliver
to Christina herself.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The said Philip shall, as of himself, express a
wish that it might please the King, now a widower,
to advance Her Grace to the honour of Queen of
England, considering her virtuous qualities were a
great deal more than ever was notified, and for a great
confirmation of amity and love to continue between
the Emperor's Majesty and the King's Highness."</p></div>

<p>Hoby was charged to take careful note of the
Duchess's answers, gestures, and expression, and
was especially to note if she seemed favourably
inclined to these proposals, in order that he might
be able to satisfy Henry's anxiety on the subject.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p>Philip Hoby was too accomplished a courtier not
to discharge his errand with tact and courtesy. The
Duchess was graciously pleased to accede to his
request, and at one o'clock the next day Holbein was
ushered by Messer Benedetto into his mistress's
presence. The time allowed for the sitting was short,
but Master Hans was an adept at his art, and had
already taken drawings in this swift and masterly
fashion of all the chief personages at the English Court.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Having but three hours' space," wrote Hutton,
"he showed himself to be master of that science.
For his picture is very perfect; the other is but
slobbered in comparison to it, as by the sight of
both your lordship shall well perceive."<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>An hour afterwards Hoby and the painter both
took leave of the Duchess and started for England.
In order to avoid suspicion and observe the
strict secrecy enjoined by Cromwell, Hoby did not
even seek a farewell audience from the Regent,
who contented herself with sending friendly greetings
to the Lord Privy Seal, saying that he should hear
from her more at large through the Imperial Ambassadors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March</span>, 1538 AT HAMPTON COURT</div>

<p>The precious sketch, from which Holbein afterwards
made "the great table"<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> which hung in the Palace of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>Westminster until Henry's death, was safely delivered
into Cromwell's hands, and shown by him to
the King on the 18th of March. Henry was singularly
pleased with the portrait, and, as his courtiers
noticed, seemed to be in better humour than for
months past. For the first time since Queen Jane's
death he sent for his musicians, and made them play
to him all the afternoon and evening. Two days
afterwards he went to Hampton Court, and "gave
orders for new and sumptuous buildings" at this
riverside palace. After that he returned to Whitehall
by water, accompanied by his whole troop of
musicians, paid a visit to his brother-in-law's wife,
Katherine, Duchess of Suffolk, and resumed his old
habit of going about with a few of his favourites in
masks&mdash;"a sure sign," remarked Chapuys, "that he
is going to marry again."</p>

<p>The Imperial Ambassadors, Chapuys and his
colleague Don Diego Mendoza, were now treated with
extraordinary civility. They were invited to Hampton
Court, where Henry entertained them at a
splendid banquet, and showed them his "fine new
lodgings" and the priceless tapestries and works of
art with which Cardinal Wolsey had adorned this
magnificent house. The next day they were taken
to the royal manor of Nonsuch to see the little Prince,
"one of the prettiest children you ever saw, and his
sister, Madam Elizabeth, who is also a sweet little
girl." Then they went on to Richmond to visit Princess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>Mary, who played to them with rare skill on both
spinet and lute, and spoke of her cousin the Emperor
in terms of the deepest gratitude. The French
Ambassadors, Castillon and the Bishop of Tarbes,
who arrived at Hampton Court just as the Imperial
Envoys were leaving, were received with marked
coolness, a treatment, as Chapuys shrewdly remarks,
"no doubt artfully designed to excite their jealousy."<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1538</span>] CHRISTINA'S CHARM</div>

<p>The sight of Holbein's portrait revived Henry's wish
to see Christina, and he pressed Chapuys earnestly to
induce his good sister the Queen of Hungary to bring
her niece to meet him at Calais. But on this point Mary
was obdurate. She told the Ambassador that this
was out of the question, and although she wrote civilly
to the Lord Privy Seal, thanking him for his good offices,
she complained bitterly to Chapuys of Cromwell's
extraordinary proceeding in sending the painter to
Brussels, and laid great stress on her condescension
in allowing him to take her niece's portrait. So far
Charles himself had never written fully to his sister
on the subject, and Mary asked Chapuys repeatedly
if these proposals really came from the Emperor,
and if the King and Cromwell were sincere. As for
her part, she believed these flattering words were
merely intended to deceive her. Chapuys could only
assure her that both Henry and his Minister were
very much in earnest. When the courier arrived
from Spain, the King was bitterly disappointed
because there was no letter from Charles, and sent
Cromwell twice to implore the Ambassadors, for
God's sake, to tell him if they had any good news
to impart. On Lady Day the Minister came to
Chapuys's lodgings, and, after two hours' earnest conversation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>went away "somewhat consoled." The
next day Henry sent for the Ambassadors, and discussed
the subject in the frankest, most familiar
manner, ending by saying with a merry laugh:
"You think it a good joke, I trow, to see me in love
at my age!"</p>

<p>In his impatience, Henry complained that Hutton
was remiss in his duties, and did not say enough
about the Duchess in his despatches. Yet the
excellent Ambassador was unremitting in his attendance
on Her Grace, and spent many hours daily at
Court, watching her closely when she danced or played
at cards, and telling the King that he "felt satisfied
that her great modesty and gentleness proceeded from
no want of wit, but that she was rather to be esteemed
wisest among the wise."<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>From the day of Hoby's visit Christina treated
Hutton with marked friendliness, and threw aside
much of her reserve in talking with him. On the
bright spring days, when the Queen and her niece
hunted daily in the forest, the Englishman seldom
failed to accompany them. He admired the Duchess's
bold horsemanship, and was much struck by the
evident delight which she and her aunt took in
this favourite sport. By way of ingratiating himself
with Mary, he presented her with four couple
of English hounds, "the fairest that he had ever
seen," and a fine gelding, which made Christina
remark that he had done the Queen a great pleasure,
and that she had never seen her aunt so well mounted.
Hutton hastened to reply that, since Her Grace was
good enough to admire the horse, he would do his
utmost to secure another as good for her own use,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
which offer she accepted graciously.<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> All these incidents
naturally provoked attention, and, in spite
of the secrecy with which the negotiations were
carried on, the King's marriage with the Duchess of
Milan was freely discussed both in Flanders and in
England.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Few Englishmen," wrote the Duke of Norfolk
to Cromwell on the 6th of April, "will regret the
King of Scots' marriage to Madame de Longueville,
hoping that one of Burgundian blood may have the
place she might have had."<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p></div>

<p>And the report that after Easter the King was going
to meet his future bride at Calais became so persistent
that even Castillon believed it, and complained to
his royal master of the strange alteration in Henry's
behaviour, and of the marvellous haughtiness and
coldness with which he was now treated.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1538</span>] MARRIAGE NEGOTIATIONS</div>

<p>On the 27th of March the Imperial Ambassadors
dined at the Lord Privy Seal's house, to meet
Archbishop Cranmer, Chancellor Audley, Thomas
Brandon, Duke of Suffolk, the Lord High Admiral
Southampton, and two other Bishops, who were the
Commissioners appointed to treat of two royal marriages.
One of these was the long-planned union of
Princess Mary with the Infant Don Louis of Portugal,
brother of the reigning King, which was the ostensible
object of Don Diego's mission to England. The other
was the King's own marriage with the Duchess, which
Henry sent word must be arranged at once, since
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>until this was concluded he absolutely refused to
treat of his daughter's alliance with the Infant. As
they sat down at table, by way of <i>Benedicite</i>, remarks
Chapuys, the King's deputies began by rejoicing
to think they had not to deal with Frenchmen,
and pouring scorn on their mendacious habits. But
before the end of the meeting many difficulties had
arisen. First of all the English Commissioners demanded
that the Count Palatine should renounce all
his wife's rights to the crown of Denmark without
compensation. Then the question of the Papal
dispensation, which was necessary owing to Christina's
relationship to Katherine of Aragon, was
mooted, and, as Chapuys soon realized, was likely to
prove an insuperable difficulty, since nothing would
induce Henry to recognize the Pope's authority.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p>During the next few weeks several meetings between
the Commissioners took place, and the Ambassadors
were repeatedly admitted to confer with
the King and his Privy Council; but little progress
was made, and Chapuys informed the Regent that
there was even less hope of agreement than there
had been at first. Henry on his part complained
loudly of the coldness of the Imperial Envoys, and
of their evident desire to push forward the Portuguese
marriage and drop his own, which was the one thing
for which he really cared.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> An attempt to effect
some mode of reconciliation between him and the
Pope only incensed Henry, who sent two Doctors of
Law, Bonner and Haynes, to Madrid, to protest
against the meeting of a General Council, and to
point out how the Bishops of Rome wrested Scripture
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>to the maintenance of their lusts and worldly advantage.
And he told Don Diego angrily that the
meeting of a Council would do him the worst injury
in the world, since if he refused to attend it he would
be cut off from the rest of Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> To add to
the King's ill-temper, he was suffering from a return
of the ulcers in the leg from which he had formerly
suffered, and for some days his condition excited
serious alarm.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1538</span>] LOUISE DE GUISE</div>

<p>On his recovery, Castillon, who had been looking
on with some amusement while the Emperor's folk
were "busy brewing marriages," approached His
Majesty with flattering words, and tried to instil
suspicions of Cromwell into his mind. Henry swallowed
the bait greedily, and the French Ambassador's
remarks on his favourite's "great Spanish passion"
rankled in his mind to so great an extent that he sent
for Cromwell and rated him soundly, telling him
that he was quite unfit to meddle in the affairs of
Kings. The wily Frenchman, satisfied that the only
way of managing this wayward monarch was to
make him fall in love, took advantage of his present
mood to speak to him of the Queen of Scotland's
sister, Louise de Guise, whom he described as being
quite as beautiful as herself, with the additional
advantage of being a maid, and not a widow. Henry,
who was on his way to Mass when Castillon made
this suggestion, slapped him familiarly on the back,
and laughed, saying he must hear more of this young
lady. The next day the Comptroller of the King's
Household was sent to ask the Ambassador for particulars
about Mademoiselle de Guise, and was told
that she was so like Madame de Longueville that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>would hardly know the sisters apart, and that a
Scotchman who had seen both, wondered how King
James could prefer Mary to so lovely a creature as
Louise. The French Ambassador now found himself
overwhelmed with attentions. The King sent
him presents of venison and artichokes from his
gardens, invited him to spend Sunday at Greenwich,
and, when the plague broke out in London,
lent him the beautiful old house in Chelsea which
had belonged to Sir Thomas More, as a country
residence.<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The wedding of King James was finally celebrated
at Ch&acirc;teaudun on the 9th of May, and, hearing that
the Duke of Guise and his fair daughter Louise had
accompanied the new Queen to Havre, Henry sent
Philip Hoby across the Channel to see Mademoiselle de
Guise and have her picture painted. These orders
were duly executed, and Louise's portrait, probably
painted by Holbein, was placed in the King's hands.
But, although Henry "did not find the portrait ugly,"
he was now anxious to see Louise's younger sister,
Ren&eacute;e, who was said to be still more beautiful, and
would not be put off when Castillon told him that
she was about to take the veil in a convent at Reims.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"No doubt," remarked Montmorency, the Constable
of France, "as King Henry has made himself
Pope in his own country, he would prefer a nun to
any other Princess."<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p></div>

<p>Nothing would now satisfy Henry but that the
French King or Queen should meet him at Calais
with the Duke of Guise's daughters, Mademoiselle de
Lorraine, and Mademoiselle de Vend&ocirc;me, who had
all been recommended to his notice. When the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>English Envoy, Brian, proposed this to Queen
Eleanor, she replied indignantly that she was not a
keeper of harlots, and the Constable told Castillon
once more that French Princesses were not to be
trotted out like hackneys at a fair. At last the
Ambassador, tired of repeating that this plan was
impossible, asked Henry if the Knights of King
Arthur's Round Table had ever treated ladies in such
a fashion. This brought the King to his senses.
He reddened and hesitated, and, after rubbing his
nose for some moments, said that his proposal might
have sounded a little uncivil, but he had been so
often deceived in these matters that he could trust
no one but himself.<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a></p>

<p>Still Henry would not give up all hope of winning
the fair Louise, and towards the end of August he
sent Philip Hoby on a fresh errand to Joinville. As
before, he was to take Holbein with him, and, after
viewing well the younger sister, ask the Duchess
of Guise for leave to take the portraits of both her
daughters, Louise and Ren&eacute;e, "in one faire table."
Hoby was to explain that he had business in these
parts, and that, since he had already made acquaintance
with Mademoiselle de Guise at Havre, he could
not pass Joinville without saluting her. On leaving
Joinville he was to proceed to the Duke of Lorraine's
Court, and inform him that the Lord Privy Seal,
having heard that His Excellency had a daughter of
excellent quality, begged that the King's painter might
be allowed to take her portrait. On the 30th of August
the travellers reached Joinville, as we learn from
the following letter addressed by the Duchess of
Guise to her eldest daughter in Scotland:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1538</span>] HOLBEIN AT JOINVILLE</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is but two days since the King of England's
gentleman who was at Havre, and the painter, were
here. The gentleman came to see me, pretending
that he was on his way to find the Emperor, and,
having heard that Louise was ill, would not pass by
without inquiring after her, that he might take
back news of her health to the King his master. He
begged to be allowed to see her, which he did, although
it was a day when the fever was on her, and repeated
the same words which he had already said to me.
He then told me that, as he was so near Lorraine,
he meant to go on to Nancy to see the country. I
have no doubt that he was going there to draw
Mademoiselle's portrait, in the same way that he has
drawn the others, and so I sent down to the gentleman's
lodgings, and found that the said painter
was there. Since then they have been at Nancy,
where they spent a day and were well feasted and
entertained, and at every meal the <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>
ate with them, and many presents were made them.
That is all I know yet, but you see that, at the worst,
if you do not have your sister for a neighbour, you
may yet have your cousin."<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p></div>

<p>This time Hoby's journey was evidently unsuccessful.
Louise was ill of intermittent fever, and Ren&eacute;e
had already been sent to the convent at Reims,
where she was afterwards professed; and it is clear
from Antoinette's letters that she had no wish to
marry either of her daughters to Henry. A month
before, on the 3rd of August, she wrote to the Queen
of Scotland: "I have heard nothing more of the
proposals which you know of"; and again on the
18th: "I have begged your father to speak of these
affairs to the King, that we may be rid of them if
possible, for no one could ever be happy with such
a man."<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></p>

<p>As for Anne de Lorraine, in spite of many excellent
qualities, she lacked the beauty and charm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>of her cousins, and, as her aunt Antoinette said,
"elle est bien honn&ecirc;te, mais pas si belle que je
voudrais."<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1538</span>] HENRY'S SCRUPLES</div>

<p>The result of these disappointments was to revive
Henry's wish to marry Christina. Several times in
the course of the summer Castillon remarked that
this monarch was still hankering after the Duchess of
Milan, and had repeatedly tried to induce the Regent
to bring her niece to meet him at Brussels. "The
King my master," said Cromwell to Chapuys, "will
never marry one, who is to be his companion for life,
without he has first seen and known her."<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> In a
long and careful paper of instructions which Henry
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>drew up for the Ambassador Wyatt, he lays great
stress on this point.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"His Grace, prudently considering how that marriage
is a bargain of such nature as may endure for
the whole life of man, and a thing whereof the
pleasure and quiet, or the displeasure and torment,
doth much depend, thinketh it to be most necessary,
both for himself and the party with whom it shall
please God to join him in marriage, that the one
might see the other before the time that they should
be so affianced, which point His Highness hath
largely set forth heretofore to the Emperor's Ambassador."<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p></div>

<p>But on her side Mary was equally inflexible.
Nothing would induce her to take a step forward
in this direction, and even Hutton began to realize
how coldly the marriage overtures were received at
Brussels. The Queen never failed to ask after the
King's health or to express her anxiety for the
strengthening of the ancient friendship between the
realm of England and the House of Burgundy; but
when the Ambassador ventured to allude to the
subject of her niece's preferment, she invariably
gave an evasive reply. Since both the Queen and
the Duchess spent much of the summer hunting
in the Forest of Soignies, or in more distant parts,
Hutton seldom had an opportunity of seeing Christina.
Her servants were still very friendly, especially
the Lord Benedick Court, as Hutton calls the
Italian master of her household. One evening in
June, when Hutton had been at Court, Benedetto
came back to supper with him, whether of his own
accord or at his mistress's command the Englishman
could not tell. As they walked along the street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
Benedetto asked the Ambassador if he had brought
the Queen any good news about the Duchess. Hutton
replied that the first good news must come from the
Emperor, and, to his mind, was a long time upon
the road. The old man looked up to heaven, and said
devoutly: "I pray God that I may live to see her
given to your master, even if I die the next day.
But," he added significantly, "there is one doubt in
the matter." Hutton asked eagerly what this might
be, upon which Benedetto explained that, as the
King's first wife, the Lady Katherine, was near of
kin to the Duchess, the marriage could not be
solemnized without the Pope's dispensation, and this
he feared His Majesty would never accept. The
Ambassador replied warmly that he did not know
what might be against the Bishop of Rome's laws,
but that he was quite sure his master would do
nothing against God's laws. Then they sat down to
supper with other guests, and nothing further was
said on the subject. But the old Italian knew what
he was talking about, and the Papal dispensation
proved to be the one insuperable obstacle which stood
in the way of a settlement.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1538</span>] DEATH OF HUTTON</div>

<p>Another of Christina's servants, Gian Battista
Ferrari, paid a visit to England this summer, and
brought back glowing accounts of the beauties of
London and the splendours of King Henry's Court.
He had an Italian friend named Panizone, who was
one of the royal equerries, and had been sent over
to England with some Barbary horses from the
Gonzaga stables. Panizone introduced him to Cromwell,
who entertained him hospitably, and sent him
back to tell his mistress all that he had seen and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>done at the Court of Whitehall. Christina was exceedingly
curious to hear Battista's account of his
visit, and was surprised when he told her that England
was as beautiful as Italy. When she proceeded
to inquire if he had seen the King, Battista replied
that he had been fortunate enough to be received
by His Majesty, and broke into ecstatic praises of
Henry's comeliness, gracious manners, and liberality.
The Duchess said that she had often heard
praises of His Grace, and was glad to know from
Battista's lips that they were true. After supper
she sent for him again, and he informed her that
Chapuys had told him the marriage would shortly
be concluded. "At this it seemeth she did much
rejoice." So at least Battista assured Hutton.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
Ferrari himself was evidently very anxious to see
his mistress Queen of England, and in a letter which
he addressed on the 7th of September to his friend,
"Guglielmo Panizone scudier del Invictissimo R&egrave;
d' Inghilterr&agrave; a Londra, alla Corte di sua Maest&agrave;,"
he wrote, "Madama the Duchess, my mistress,
loves the King truly," and proceeded to send commendations
to the Lord Privy Seal, Signor Filippo
(Hoby), Portinari, and others. This letter contained
one sad piece of news. "The Ambassador here is
said to be dying; I am grieved because of the friendship
between us and his excellent qualities. The next
one we have will, I hope, be yourself."<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> Battista's
news was true. Honest John Hutton, the popular
Governor of the Merchant Adventurers, fell ill at
Antwerp, and died there on the 5th of September.
His genial nature had made him a general favourite,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>and he was lamented by everyone at Court. "It is
a great loss," wrote Don Diego to Cromwell, "because
he was so good a servant and so merry and honest
a soul." To his own master, the Emperor, he remarked
that the English Ambassador who had just
died was a jovial, good-natured man, but more fit
for courtly functions and social intercourse than
grave political business, for which he had neither
taste nor capacity.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The meeting of the Emperor and King of France
at Aigues-Mortes in July, 1538, produced a marked
change in the political situation. This interview,
which the Pope had failed to bring about at Nice,
was finally effected by Queen Eleanor, and the two
monarchs, who had not met since Francis was a
prisoner at Madrid, embraced each other, dined
together, and ended by swearing an inviolable friendship.
The truce was converted into a lasting peace,
and several marriages between the two families were
discussed in a friendly and informal manner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Never," wrote the Constable to Castillon, "were
there two faster friends than the King and Emperor,
and I do not for a moment imagine that His Imperial
Majesty will ever allow the Widow of Milan to marry
King Henry! So do not believe a single word that
you hear in England!"<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1538</span>] CROMWELL AND CHAPUYS</div>

<p>This unexpected reconciliation was a bitter pill
to Henry and Cromwell. The French and Imperial
Ambassadors at Whitehall exchanged the warmest
congratulations, and did not fail to indulge in a
hearty laugh at King Henry's expense. On the
21st of August Chapuys and Don Diego followed the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>Court to Ampthill, where the King was hunting, and
were entertained by Cromwell at one of his own
manors. As they sat down to dinner, the Lord Privy
Seal asked brusquely if it were true that the King
and Emperor had made peace, to which the Ambassadors
replied in the affirmative. He then proceeded
to start a variety of disagreeable topics. First he
remarked that he heard the Turk was already in
Belgrade; next he said that the young Duke of Cleves
had taken possession of Guelderland, upon which
Chapuys retaliated by expatiating on the perfect
friendship and understanding between Charles and
Francis. After dinner they were admitted into
the King's presence, and informed him that the
Queen of Hungary had received the powers necessary
for the conclusion of the Duchess's marriage, and
wished to recall Don Diego in order that he might
draw up the contract. Henry expressed great sorrow
at parting from the Spaniard, and, drawing him apart,
begged him to induce the Queen to treat directly
with him, repeating two or three times that he was
growing old, and could not put off taking a wife any
longer. Meanwhile Cromwell was telling Chapuys,
in another corner of the hall, how much annoyed the
King had been to hear that the Emperor was treating
of his niece's marriage with the Duke of Cleves,
which would make people say either that she had
refused the King or else had only accepted Henry
after refusing Cleves. Chapuys stoutly denied the
truth of this report, and Cromwell confessed that the
King was very eager for the marriage, and, if there were
any difficulty about the Duchess's dowry, he would
gladly give her 20,000 crowns out of his own purse.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Ambassadors were putting on their riding-boots,
Cromwell ran after Don Diego with a present
from his master of &pound;400, after which they returned
to London and dined in Chelsea with Castillon, to
meet Madame de Montreuil, the lady-in-waiting
of the late Queen Madeleine of Scotland, who was returning
to France. They all spent a merry evening,
laughing over King Henry's matrimonial plans, and
Castillon declared that the King and Lord Privy Seal
were so much perturbed at his master's alliance with
the Emperor that they hardly knew if they were in
heaven or on earth.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1538</span>] STEPHEN VAUGHAN</div>

<p>Don Diego arrived in Flanders to find general rejoicings&mdash;"gun-shots
and melody and jousting were
the order of the day"&mdash;and an English merchant
declared that the proud Spaniards were ready to
challenge all the world. Queen Mary marked the
occasion by honouring her favourite, Count Henry of
Nassau, with a visit at his Castle of Breda in Holland.
The beautiful gardens and vast orchards planted
in squares, after the fashion of Italy, which excited
the Cardinal of Aragon's admiration, were in their
summer beauty, and a series of magnificent f&ecirc;tes
were given in honour of the Queen and her companion,
the Duchess of Milan. The Count was assisted in
doing the honours by his third wife, the Marchioness
of Zeneta, a rich Spanish heiress, whom the Emperor
had given him in marriage, and his son Ren&eacute;, Prince
of Orange. The presence of Christina at Breda on
this occasion, and the attentions that were paid her
by her hosts, naturally gave rise to a report that she
was about to wed the Prince, and Cromwell told
Don Diego before he left Dover that this rumour had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>caused the King great annoyance.<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> But the festivities
at Breda met with a tragic close. On the
day after the royal ladies left the castle, Henry of
Nassau died very suddenly, and Don Diego heard
the sad news when he reached the castle gates, on
his way to salute his kinswoman, the Marchioness.</p>

<p>The Ambassador now hastened to Court, and craved
an audience of the Queen to deliver King Henry's
letters; but he found her little inclined to attend to
business, and engaged in preparations to pay a visit
to King Francis, who had gallantly invited her to
a hunting-party at Compi&egrave;gne. At first there had
been some doubt if the Duchess should be of the
party, but Queen Eleanor was eager to see her niece,
and Christina was nothing loth to take part in these
brilliant festivities. Meanwhile Henry's renewed impatience
to conclude his marriage was shown by the
promptitude with which another Ambassador was
sent to take Hutton's place.</p>

<p>On the 27th of September the new Envoy, Stephen
Vaughan, was admitted into the Queen's presence,
and begged for an answer to the letters delivered by
Don Diego. Mary told him that he might inform
His Majesty that there was no truth in the reports
of her niece's marriage, and that, if any coolness had
arisen between them, it was the King's own fault
for seeking a wife in other places. Hoby's mission
to Joinville and Nancy was, it is plain, well known
at Brussels. But the Queen kept her counsel, and
told Vaughan that, if his master was still in the same
mind, she would urge the Emperor to hasten the
conclusion of the treaty. Only she must beg the
Ambassador to have a little patience, as her time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
was fully occupied at this moment. But the next
day he was again put off, and told the Queen would
see him when she reached Mons. Accordingly,
Vaughan and his colleague, Thomas Wriothesley,
Cromwell's confidential secretary, arrived at this
town on the 8th, only to be told by Don Diego that
they must await the Queen's pleasure at Valenciennes.
The Spanish Ambassador did his best to
atone for their disappointment by giving them an
excellent dinner, and lending them two of his own
horses with velvet saddles and rich trappings for
the journey.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1538</span>] AT COMPI&Egrave;GNE</div>

<p>At length, at eight on Sunday morning, the 6th
of October, they were conducted into the Queen's
presence by the Grand Falconer, Molembais, and
Vaughan, who spoke French fluently, explained
Henry's reasons for arranging the marriage treaty
without delay. Mary replied briefly that she had
already written to accede to the King's request, and
that no further steps could be taken until after her
meeting with the French King. Dinner was being
served while she spoke these words, and, as the meat
was actually coming in, the Ambassadors were
compelled to retire. Before they left the room,
however, they saluted the Duchess, who was standing
near her aunt, and ventured to tell her how much
my Lord Privy Seal remained her humble servant,
although, as she no doubt knew, his overtures had
been so coldly received. Christina smiled and
thanked them for their good-will with a gentle grace,
which went far to mollify their ruffled feelings, and
made Wriothesley write home that all Hutton had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>said of the Duchess's charms was true. "She is as
goodly personage, of stature higher than either of us,
and hath a very good woman's face, competently
fair and well favoured, but a little brown."<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p>As if to make amends for these delays, the great
lords in attendance overwhelmed the Ambassadors
with civilities. Aerschot invited them to dinner;
Count B&uuml;ren embraced them warmly and asked affectionately
after the King; De Praet, Molembais, and
Iselstein, escorted them to the door, and Don Diego
made them a present of wine. When Wriothesley
fell ill of fever at Cambray, the Queen sent her own
physician to attend him, and begged him either to
remain there or return to Brussels. This he refused
to do, and travelled on by slow stages to Compi&egrave;gne,
hoping to obtain another audience there. But the
roads were bad, and two leagues from Cambray one
of the carts broke down, leaving the English without
household stuff or plate when Don Diego came to
supper.<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a></p>

<p>On Tuesday news reached Cambray that King
Francis was on his way to salute the Queen, and
Mary rode out to meet him, leaving the Duchess of
Milan at home with others, who like herself, remarks
Wriothesley, had no great liking for Frenchmen.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> But
the King's greeting was most cordial, and when, on
the following day, Queen Eleanor arrived with a great
train of lords and ladies, there was much feasting
and merriment, until on the 10th the whole party
started for Compi&egrave;gne.</p>

<p>It was a brilliant company that met in the ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>castle of the French Kings, in the forest on the banks
of the Oise, near the bridge where, a hundred years
before, Jeanne d'Arc had made her last heroic stand.
King Francis had summoned all the Princes and Princesses
of the blood to do honour to the Queen of
Hungary, and the neighbouring villages were filled
to overflowing with Court officials and servants.
There was the King himself, a fine figure in cloth of
gold and nodding plumes, gallant as ever in spite of
ill-health and advancing years, with a glance and
smile to spare for every fair lady; and there was his
consort, Queen Eleanor, too often neglected by her
fickle lord, but now radiant with happiness, and in her
beautiful robes and priceless pearls, as winning and
almost as fair as when she fascinated the young
Palatine twenty years ago. The sense of family
affection was as strong in Eleanor as in all the Habsburgs,
and she was overjoyed to meet her sister and
embrace the daughter of the beloved and lamented
Isabella. With her came the King's daughter Margaret,
the homely-featured but pleasing and accomplished
Princess for whom a royal husband was still
to be found, and who, the courtiers whispered, might
now wed the Prince of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1538</span>] A BRILLIANT COMPANY</div>

<p>Her brothers were there too&mdash;the dull and morose
Henry, who had succeeded his elder brother as
Dauphin two years before, but had never recovered
from the effects of his long captivity in Spain; and
the more lively but weak and vicious Charles of
Angoul&ecirc;me, now Duke of Orleans, whom Eleanor was
so anxious to see married to the Duchess of Milan.
With them was the Dauphin's Italian wife, Catherine
de' Medici, whose wit and grace atoned in her father-in-law's
eyes for her lack of beauty, although her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
husband's heart was given to Diane de Poitiers,
and a childless marriage made her unpopular in the
eyes of the nation. But a galaxy of fair ladies surrounded
the King and Queen. Chief among them
was Madame d'&Eacute;tampes, whose dazzling charms had
captivated the fickle King, and who now reigned
supreme both in Court and Council. Of the youthful
ladies whose charms had aroused King Henry's interest,
only Mademoiselle de Vend&ocirc;me was here. The
fair Louise had not yet recovered from her illness, and
the Duchess of Guise was nursing her at Joinville.
But both her father, Claude of Guise, the Governor
of Burgundy, and his brother, the Cardinal of Lorraine,
were present, and held a high place in the King's
favour. Claude's elder brother, the Duke of Lorraine,
had lately been to meet the Emperor at Aigues-Mortes
and plead his claims to Guelders, but on his
return he fell ill with a severe attack of gout, and
was unable to obey the King's summons. In his
stead he sent Duchess Ren&eacute;e his wife, another
Bourbon Princess, a daughter of Gilbert de Montpensier
and sister of the famous Constable. Her
daughter Anne remained at home to nurse the Duke,
but her eldest son, Francis, came with his mother to
Compi&egrave;gne. This cultured and polished Prince, who
bore the King's name, had been brought up at the
French Court, and could ride and joust as well as any
of his peers; but he was quite thrown into the shade
by his cousin, Antoine de Bourbon, Duke of Vend&ocirc;me,
the darling of the people and the idol of all the ladies.
A head and shoulders taller than the Dauphin and his
brother, Antoine was the cynosure of all eyes at Court
festivals. The elegance of his attire, the inimitable
grace with which he raised his hat, his wit and gaiety,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
fascinated every woman, while the gilded youth of
the day copied the fashion of his clothes and the
precise angle at which he wore the feather in his cap.
Frivolous, volatile, and recklessly extravagant, Vend&ocirc;me
wore his heart on his sleeve, and was ready to
enter the lists for the sake of any fair lady. He fell
desperately in love with the Duchess of Milan at first
sight, and devoted himself to her service. As premier
Prince of the blood, he rode at Christina's side, and led
her out to dance in the eyes of the Court. Together they
joined in the hunting-parties that were organized on
a vast scale in the Forest of Compi&egrave;gne, and while all
the French were lost in admiration at the fine horsemanship
of the royal ladies, Antoine de Bourbon
threw himself at the Duchess's feet, and declared
himself her slave for life. But whether this gay
cavalier was too wild and thoughtless for her taste,
or whether her heart was already given to another,
Christina paid little heed to this new suitor, and
remained cold to his impassioned appeals. "The
Duke of Vend&ocirc;me," wrote Wriothesley to Cromwell,
"is a great wooer to the Duchess, but we cannot hear
that he receiveth much comfort."<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1538</span>] A VISIT TO CHANTILLY</div>

<p>On the 17th of October the Constable de Montmorency
prevailed on the royal party to accompany
him to his sumptuous home at Chantilly, nine leagues
farther on the road to Paris. This brave soldier and
able Minister had grown up in the closest intimacy
with the Royal Family, and was habitually addressed
as "bon p&egrave;re" by the King's children, but had, unfortunately,
excited the hatred of the reigning
favourite, the Duchess of &Eacute;tampes, who called him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>openly "un grand coquin," and declared that he tried
to make himself a second monarch. On the other hand,
his constant loyalty to Queen Eleanor gratified Mary
of Hungary, who now gladly accepted his invitation
to Chantilly.</p>

<p>Anne de Montmorency was as great a patron of
art as his royal master, and during the last fifteen
years he had transformed his ancestral home into a
superb Renaissance palace. The halls were decorated
with frescoes by Primaticcio; the gardens were adorned
with precious marbles and bronzes, with busts of the
C&aelig;sars and statues of Mars and Hercules, with fountains
of the finest Urbino and Palissy ware. Portraits
by Clouet, priceless manuscripts illuminated by
French and Burgundian masters, and enamels by
L&eacute;onard Limousin, were to be seen in the galleries.
But what interested Mary and Christina most of all
were the tapestries woven at Brussels from Raphael
of Urbino's cartoons, which the Constable had rescued
after the sack of Rome, and which he restored some
years later to Pope Julius III.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>After entertaining his guests magnificently during
two days, the Constable accompanied them on a
hunting-party in the forest, and finally brought
them back to Compi&egrave;gne on the 19th of October.
Here the Queen of Hungary's return was impatiently
awaited by the English Ambassadors, who
found themselves in a miserable plight. The town
was so crowded that they had to be content with the
meanest lodgings; the hire of post-horses cost forty
pounds, and provisions were so scarce that a partridge
or woodcock sold for tenpence, and an orange for
more than a groat. The King's Ambassadors at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
French Court&mdash;Sir Anthony Browne, and Bonner,
the Bishop-elect of Hereford&mdash;who joined them at
Compi&egrave;gne on the 14th, were in still worse case; for
they could get no horses for love or money, and
spent six days without receiving a visit from the
Court officials. These outraged personages stood at the
window, and saw the French Councillors, and even the
Constable, go by, without giving them the smallest sign
of recognition. At least, Vaughan and Wriothesley
were treated with the utmost civility by the Flemish
nobles, and their audience was only deferred on
account of the Queen's visit to Chantilly. Don Diego
was courtesy itself, and, before he started for Spain,
wrote a letter to Cromwell, assuring him that Queen
Mary was the truest friend and sister his master could
have, but that it had been impossible for her to
attend to business when her days were spent in festivities
and family meetings.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> At length, on Sunday,
the 20th, the Ambassadors were received by the
Queen, and introduced Browne and Bonner, as well
as Dr. Edward Carne, a learned lawyer whom
Henry had sent to assist in drawing up the marriage
treaty. Mary informed them that Francis was bent
on taking her to the Duke of Vend&ocirc;me's house at La
F&egrave;re on the way home, but begged Wriothesley, who
was still unwell, to go straight to Brussels. The next
day Browne started for England, saying that it was
impossible to follow a King who "goes out of all
highways," and on the 22nd Wriothesley and his
companions set out on their return to Brussels.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1538</span>] MARRIAGE-MAKING</div>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>By the end of October the English Envoys were
back at Brussels, rejoicing to be once more in comfortable
quarters. Here they found great fear and
distrust of France prevailing, and much alarm was
expressed lest the Queen should have been induced
to give the Duchess of Milan in marriage to a French
Prince. This, however, was not the case, and the
English Ambassadors were satisfied that beyond
feasting and merrymaking nothing had been done.
A friendly gentleman, Monsieur de Brederode, told
them that there had been some attempt at marriage-making
among the women. Queen Eleanor still
pressed her sister earnestly to further the marriage
of Christina with the Duke of Orleans, as the
best way of insuring a lasting peace, and had revived
her old dream of marrying her daughter, Maria of
Portugal, to the Prince of Spain. But Mary turned
a deaf ear to all these proposals, saying that she could
not consider them without Charles's approval. At
La F&egrave;re, in the valley of the Oise, Francis entertained
his guests at a splendid banquet, after which he presented
Mary with a very fine diamond, and Christina
with a beautiful jewel, besides lavishing rings, bracelets,
brooches, caps, and pretty trinkets from Paris
and Milan, Lisbon and Nuremberg, on the ladies of
their suite. Here he took leave of his guests, but
the Duke of Vend&ocirc;me insisted on escorting the Queen
and her niece as far as Valenciennes.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1538</span>] KING HENRY'S ANGER</div>

<p>On Monday, the 4th of November, Mary and Christina
reached Brussels, and were received with warm
demonstrations of affection. Now, "after all these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>gay and glorious words," the English Ambassadors
confidently hoped to see some end to their toil. But
they soon realized that their hopes were doomed to
disappointment. First the Queen was too tired to
receive them; then nothing could be done until the
return of the Duke of Aerschot, who was her chief
adviser. At length, on the 16th, the first conference
took place at the Duke's house. The Captain of the
Archers, Christina's old friend De Courri&egrave;res, conducted
the Ambassadors to the room where the Commissioners
were awaiting them&mdash;Aerschot, Hoogstraaten,
Lalaing, and the Chancellor of Brabant, Dr.
Schoren, "a very wise father." After a lengthy
preamble, setting forth the powers committed to the
Regent, the terms of the contract were discussed.
The chief points on which Wriothesley insisted were
that Henry should be allowed to see his bride, that
the payment of her dowry should be assigned to
Flanders instead of Milan, and that Christina's title
to Denmark should be recognized, although, remarked
the Ambassador, "for my little wit I care not
if this last condition were scraped out of the book."<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>
The Duchess's claim to the throne of Denmark, as
Wriothesley realized, was so remote that it seemed
hardly worth discussing. The dowry and the question
of the Papal dispensation were the two real
stumbling-blocks, and he advised Cromwell, if the
King was really anxious to secure this desirable wife,
not to press the former point, money being so scarce
in Spain and the Netherlands that the Emperor
would rather leave his niece unwed, than part with
so large a sum. At the close of the sitting the Duke
of Aerschot begged Wriothesley to stay to dinner,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>and gave him the chief place at table and pre-eminence
in all things. The fare was abundant; four courses
of ten dishes were served in silver, with "covers of a
marvellous clean and honourable sort," and carvers
and waiters stood around, and attended as diligently
to the Ambassador's wants as if he were a Prince.
Later in the evening the Duke's brother-in-law, the
Marquis of Berghen, who was always well disposed
to the English, came to supper, and chatted pleasantly
for some time, but shocked Wriothesley by asking him
if it were true that all religion was extinct in England,
that Mass was abolished, and that the bones
of saints were publicly burned. Cromwell's Commissioner,
who had himself plundered the shrines of
St. Swithun at Winchester and of St. Thomas at
Canterbury, could hardly deny this latter charge,
although he declared stoutly that only such money-making
devices and tricks of the friars as the Rood
of Boxley and the tomb of Becket had been unmasked.
But, in spite of the outward civility with
which the Ambassador was treated, he realized that
all good Catholics in Flanders looked on him with
horror and disgust.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1539</span>] MARY'S APPEAL</div>

<p>All through the summer abbeys and shrines had
been going down fast. "Dagon is everywhere falling,"
wrote a Kentish fanatic, and, as Castillon said,
by the end of the year hardly a single abbey was left
standing. The recent trend of political events had
served to excite the King's worst passions, and when
the French Ambassador went to see him early in
November, he found him in a towering rage. The
French had treated his Ambassadors abominably;
the Emperor and King were plotting together to take
the Duchess of Milan away from him and give her to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Monsieur de Vend&ocirc;me, which, "if it be done, would
finish the picture."<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> Late on this same evening, Lord
Exeter, a grandson of Edward IV. and head of the
noble house of Courtenay, and his cousin, Lord Montague,
the son of Lady Salisbury and brother of
Cardinal Pole, were thrown into the Tower on the
charge of high-treason. All that the most prolonged
cross-examination of their servants and friends could
bring out to prove their guilt, was that in my Lord
of Exeter's garden at Horsley Place, in Surrey, Sir
Edward Nevill had been heard singing merry songs
against the knaves that ruled about the King, and,
clenching his fist, had cried: "I trust to give them a
buffet and see honest men reign in England one day."
But the King had long ago told the French Ambassador
that he was determined to exterminate the White
Rose, and, as Castillon remarked, no pretext was too
flimsy to bring men to the block. On the 9th of
December, Exeter, Montague, and Nevill, all died on
the scaffold, and Castillon wrote to King Francis:
"No one knows who will be the next to go." Terror
reigned throughout the land, and no one of noble birth
was safe.<a name="FNanchor_218" id="FNanchor_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Mary of Hungary might well shudder at
the thought of giving her niece to such a man. But
every day her position became more difficult. Soon
after her return from Compi&egrave;gne she wrote to Charles,
urgently begging for instructions as to how she was
to proceed with the English Ambassadors. If the
King persists in treating of the Duchess's marriage,
is she to consent or to refuse altogether? And if
so, on what pretext? Is she to discuss the question
of the Papal dispensation, which Henry will never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>consent to receive from the Pope, but without which
the Emperor cannot possibly allow the union.<a name="FNanchor_219" id="FNanchor_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> In
reply to this letter, Charles wrote from Toledo, on the
5th of December, telling her to temporize with the
English, and to consult her Council on the best
method of procedure.<a name="FNanchor_220" id="FNanchor_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a></p>

<p>A carefully-worded paper, in Mary's own handwriting,
setting forth the results of the deliberation
with the Council in clear and concise language, was
forwarded to the Emperor early in January:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"If the King of England would seriously mend his
ways and proceed to conclude the marriage in earnest,
not merely to sow dissension between His Majesty
and the King of France, this would no doubt be the
most honourable alliance for the Duchess and the
most advantageous for the Low Countries; but there
is no evidence of this&mdash;rather the reverse, as your
Ambassador in France tells us, from what he hears of
the conversations held by King Henry with the French
Envoy in London. The Queen considers this point to
be entirely settled, and it remains only to know Your
Majesty's wishes. Are we to dissemble with the
English as we have done till now, which, however,
is very difficult, or are we to break off negotiations
altogether? This can best be done by putting forward
quite reasonable terms, but which are not agreeable
to the King. The Queen begs His Majesty to tell
her exactly what she is to do, remembering that the
King of England, when he cannot ally himself with
the Emperor or in France, may seek an alliance with
Cleves, and will be further alienated from religion, and
may do much harm by putting himself at the head of
the German Princes&mdash;all of which she prays Your
Majesty to consider."<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p></div>

<p>But no reply to this appeal came for many weeks.
In vain Mary implored Charles to put an end to this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>interminable procrastination, and relieve her from the
necessity of dissembling with the English Ambassadors,
who never left her in peace.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Once more, Monseigneur," she wrote at the end
of January, "I implore you tell me if I am to allow
these conferences to drag on, for it is impossible to do
this any longer without the most shameless dissimulation."<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a></p></div>

<p>Still no answer came from Spain, and the solemn
farce was prolonged. During the next two months
frequent meetings between the Commissioners were
held at Brussels, and the Queen herself was often
present. "Indeed," wrote Wriothesley, "she is one
and principal in it, and how unmeet we be to match
with her ourselves do well acknowledge."<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> But little
progress was made, although Henry, in his anxiety
for the marriage, offered to give the Duchess as large
a dowry as any Queen of England had ever enjoyed.
On St. Thomas's Day he informed the French Ambassador
in the gallery at Whitehall that his marriage
was almost concluded.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"All the same," wrote Castillon to the Constable,
"I know that he would gladly marry Madame de
Guise had he the chance. If you think the King and
Emperor would enjoy the sport of seeing him thus
<i>virolin-virolant</i>, I can easily get it up, provided you
show his Ambassador a little civility, and make the
Cardinal and Monsieur de Guise caress him a little."<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1539</span>] FAIR WORDS</div>

<p>But two days after this interview Henry addressed
a pathetic appeal to the Regent on his behalf, saying
that "old age was fast creeping on, and time was slipping
and flying marvellously away." Already the whole
year had been wasted in vain parleyings, and, since
neither money nor prayers could redeem this precious
time, he could wait the Emperor's pleasure no longer,
but must seek another bride. If this appeal produced
no effect, he told Wriothesley to take leave of the
Duchess, and declare to her the great affection which
the King bore her, and how earnestly he had desired
to make her his wife, but, since this was plainly impossible,
he must "beg her not to marvel if he joined
with another."<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> When this letter reached Brussels,
Mary and Christina were absent on a hunting expedition,
but on New Year's Eve they returned.
The Queen received Wriothesley the next morning,
and, after listening patiently to the long discourse
in which he delivered his master's message, said that
she was still awaiting the Emperor's final instructions,
remarking that perhaps the King hardly realized the
distance between Spain and Flanders. There was
nothing for it but to await the coming of the courier
from Spain. But even Wriothesley began to realize
that, "for all this gentle entertainment and fair words
and feastings," the deputies meant to effect nothing.</p>

<p>Like Hutton, the Ambassador felt the spell of
Christina's charms, and certain expressions which her
servants Benedetto and Ferrari had dropped, led him
to suppose that the Duchess was favourably inclined
towards his master. But he was convinced that
attempts had been made to poison her mind against
the King, and to prefer the suit of William of Cleves
or of Francis of Lorraine, who was also said to be
seeking her hand.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I know," he wrote to Cromwell, "that some of
these folks labour to avert the Duchess's mind from
the King's Majesty, and to rest herself either upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>Lorraine or Cleves; but as far as I can learn she is
wiser than they, and will in no wise hearken to them,
offering rather to live a widow than to fall from the
likelihood of being Queen, and to light so low as from
a mistress to become an underling, as she must if
she marry either of them, their fathers and mothers
being yet both alive. What for the virtue that I think
I see in her, the good nature that every man must
note her to be of, as well as her good inclination to the
King's Majesty, I have privily wished myself sometimes
that the King might take her with nothing,
as she hath somewhat, rather than His Highness
should, by these cankered tongues, be tromped and
deceived of his good purpose, and so want such a wife
as I think she would be to His Grace. For I shall
ever pray God to send His Majesty such a mate,
humble, loving, and of such sort as may be for His
Grace's quiet and content, with the increase of the
offspring of his most noble person."<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a></p></div>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>At length the eagerly-expected courier reached
Brussels, but, as usual, the Queen and Duchess were
away hunting, and it was only on the 1st of February
that the Ambassadors obtained their desired audience.
Mary received them in her bedroom between seven and
eight in the morning, and told them that the Emperor
had decided to await the arrival of the Count Palatine,
who with his wife, the Duchess's elder sister, was
shortly expected at Toledo, in order that he might
discuss the subject fully with them; but, since she
knew Henry to be impatient for an answer, she had
despatched a trusty messenger, Cornelius Scepperus, to
Spain to beg her brother for an immediate decision.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1539</span>] AN AWKWARD QUESTION</div>

<p>Wriothesley now ventured on a bold step. As the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>Queen rose to leave the room, he begged, in order to
satisfy his own peace of mind, to be allowed to ask
her one question, hoping that she would give him a
frank answer. At these words Mary blushed deeply,
conscious of the double part that she was playing,
and bade him speak, assuring him that she would take
whatever he said in good part. "Madame," returned
Wriothesley, "I beseech Your Grace to tell me plainly
how you find the Duchess herself affected towards
this marriage with the King my master." If, as was
commonly reported, the Duchess had really said that
she minded not to fix her heart that way, all his efforts
were but lost labour. And he made bold to ask this
question because he knew that of late "divers malicious
tongues, servants of the Bishop of Rome, had dared
to speak lewdly in hugger-mugger of the King's
Majesty." The question was an awkward one, but
Mary proved equal to the occasion. She thanked the
Ambassador for his frankness, and replied with
some warmth that she was quite sure her niece had
never spoken such words, and that, if evil men spoke
lewdly of the King, she would know how to deal
with them. "Touching my niece's affection," she
added, "I dare say unto you, that if the Emperor
and your master the King agree upon this marriage,
she will be at the Emperor's command."</p>

<p>Wriothesley could only express his gratitude for
this gracious answer, even if it were not so plain
as he could have wished. Seeing that nothing else
would satisfy him, the Queen referred him to the
Duchess herself, and at two o'clock the same afternoon
the Ambassador was conducted to Christina's
lodgings. He found her standing under a canopy in
a hall hung with black velvet and damask, with five or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
six ladies near her, and a dozen gentlemen and pages
at the other end of the room. Christina received him
with a graceful salute, bade him heartily welcome,
and asked the purpose of his errand. Wriothesley
proceeded to explain the object of his visit at great
length, saying that he was quite sure that a lady of
her gravity and discretion would never allow such
unseemly words to pass her lips; yet, since untrue
and wicked reports might have reached her ears and
cooled her inclination towards the King, he felt it
would be his bounden duty, were this true, to inform
His Majesty, in order that he might withdraw his
suit without further waste of time and dishonour.</p>

<p>Christina listened to this long harangue without
moving a muscle. When the Ambassador had ended,
she desired him to put on his cap, saying it was a
cold day, and that she regretted not to have noticed
that he was uncovered before. Wriothesley replied
that this was his duty, and that he hoped often to
have the honour of talking with her bareheaded in
the future. Without paying any heed to this last
remark, Christina replied in the following words:</p>

<p>"Monsieur l'Ambassadeur, I do heartily thank you
for your good opinion of me, wherein I can assure you,
you have not been deceived. I thank God He hath
given me a better stay of myself, than to be of so
light a sort as, by all likelihood, some men would
note me. And I assure you that neither these words
that you have spoken, nor any like to them, have
passed at any time from my mouth, and so I pray
you report for me."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1539</span>] CHRISTINA'S ANSWER</div>

<p>But grateful as Wriothesley expressed himself for
this frank answer, he was not yet satisfied. "It is
an evil wind, as we say in England, that bloweth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
no man good," and at least the Duchess would see
by this, how little faith was to be placed in idle tales.
"There are those," he said mysteriously, "who play
on both hands; they tell Your Excellency many
things, and us somewhat." But would she go farther,
and tell him if he might assure the King his master
of her own good inclination towards the marriage?
At these words Christina blushed exceedingly, and
said with some hesitation: "As for my inclination,
what should I say? You know I am at the Emperor's
commandment." And when the Ambassador pressed
her to be a little plainer, she smiled and repeated:
"You know I am the Emperor's poor servant, and
must follow his pleasure!"</p>

<p>"Marry!" exclaimed Wriothesley; "why, then I
may hope to be one of the first Englishmen to be
acquainted with my new mistress. Oh, madame,
how happy shall you be if you are matched with my
master&mdash;the most gentle gentleman that liveth, his
nature so benign and pleasant that I think no man
hath heard many angry words pass his mouth. As
God shall help me, if he were no King, instead of one
of the most puissant Princes of Christendom, I think,
if you saw him, you would say that for his virtues,
gentleness, wisdom, experience, goodliness of person,
and all other gifts and qualities, he were worthy to
be made a King. I know Your Grace to be of goodly
parentage, and to have many great Princesses in
your family, but if God send this to a good conclusion,
you shall be of all the rest the most happy!"</p>

<p>This fulsome panegyric was too much for Christina's
gravity. She listened for some time, like one that
was tickled, then smiled, and almost burst out laughing,
but restrained her merriment with much diffi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>culty,
and, quickly recovering herself, said gravely
that she knew His Majesty was a good and noble
Prince. "Yes, madame," replied the Ambassador,
with enthusiasm, "and you shall know this better
hereafter. And for my part, I would be content, if
only I may live to see the day of your coronation, to
say with Simeon, "Nunc dimittis servum tuum,
Domine." And he dwelt with fervour on the wish
of the English to have her for their Queen, and on
the admiration and love which the fame of her beauty
and goodness had excited in the King. Christina
bowed her thanks, saying that she was much bounden to
His Majesty for his good opinion, and then, calling her
Grand Master, bade him escort the Ambassador home.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Your Majesty," wrote Wriothesley to the King
that evening, "shall easily judge from this of what
inclination the women be, and especially the Duchess,
whose honest countenance, with the few words that
she wisely spoke, make me to think there can be no
doubt in her. A blind man should judge no colours,
but surely, Sir, after my poor understanding and the
little experience that I have, she is marvellous wise,
very gentle, and as shamefaced as ever I saw so witty
a woman. I think her wisdom is no less than the
Queen's, which, in my poor opinion, is notable for
a woman, and I am deceived if she prove not a good
wife. And somewhat the better I like her for that
I have been informed that, of all the whole stock of
them, her mother was of the best opinion in religion,
and showed it so far that both the Emperor and all the
pack of them were sore grieved with her, and seemed in
the end to hold her in contempt. I would hope no less
of the daughter, if she might be so happy as to nestle in
England. Very pure, fair of colour she is not, but a
marvellous good brownish face she hath, with fair red
lips and ruddy cheeks. And unless I be deceived in
my judgment, she was never so well painted but her
living visage doth much excel her picture."<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1539</span>] WORTHY TO BE A QUEEN</div>

<p>Two things, Wriothesley told Cromwell, in a letter
which he wrote to him the next day, were plain:
the Queen would be very loth to let them go with
nothing settled, and the Duchess was well inclined,
considering that nothing had as yet been said to her
on the King's behalf. And he suggested that he might
be allowed to show her a portrait of Henry, the sight of
which, he felt sure, would make her die a maid rather
than marry anyone else. "The woman is certainly
worthy to be a Queen," he adds, "and in my
judgment is worth more than all the friendship and
alliances in the world."<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, these letters, which the writer
hoped would give the King so much pleasure, found
Henry in a furious temper. In January, 1539, Pope
Paul III. issued the long-delayed Bull of excommunication,
and called on the Emperor and the French
King to declare war on the heretic monarch, and forbid
all intercourse between their subjects and the
misguided English. Cardinal Pole, whose kinsmen
Henry had beheaded, and whose own life had been
attempted by his emissaries, was sent to Spain to
induce Charles to take up arms against "this abominable
tyrant and cruel persecutor of the Church of
God."<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> At the same moment a treaty was signed
between Charles and Francis at Toledo, by which
the two monarchs pledged themselves to conclude
no agreements with Henry excepting by mutual
consent.<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Henry now became seriously alarmed. He complained
bitterly to Castillon of the way in which he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>was reviled in France, not only by the vulgar, but
by the Cardinal of Paris and members of the Council.
And he sent Cromwell to Chapuys with an imperative
summons to come to Court without delay. The
Imperial Ambassador obeyed, and came to Whitehall
on the Feast of the Three Kings. Henry was on his
way to Mass, but he stopped to greet Chapuys, and
complained once more of the Queen of Hungary's
interminable delays and of the scandalous treatment
of his Ambassadors. Chapuys made the best
excuses which came into his mind, and assured the
King that Mary was only awaiting the Emperor's
instructions as to the Papal dispensation, and that he
would hear from Spain as soon as the Palatine
had reached Toledo. To this Henry vouchsafed no
answer, but walked straight on, to the door of the
chapel.</p>

<p>During Mass Cromwell entered into conversation
with Chapuys, and told him that the Pope had thrown
off the hypocrite's mask, and was doing his best to
kindle a flame in Italy. Before the Ambassador
could reply he changed the subject, and said he saw
clearly that the Emperor intended to marry his niece
to Cleves or Lorraine. Chapuys laughed, and remarked
that the Duchess could hardly be given to
both Princes, but added in all seriousness that his
master knew the difference between the King of
England and these suitors. After dinner Henry
seemed in a better temper, but told Chapuys in confidential
tones that he was growing old, and that
his subjects pressed him to hasten his marriage, and
that these vexatious delays were all due to the French,
who boasted that the Emperor could do nothing
without their consent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1539</span>] A COLD FROST</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"He seemed in great trouble," reported Chapuys,
"and it is plain, as everyone about him tells me, that
he is very much in love with the Duchess of Milan.
He told one of his most intimate friends the other
day that he would gladly take her without a penny....
And just now the French Ambassador asked me
if it were true that he had sent her a diamond worth
16,000 ducats."<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p></div>

<p>At the same time Chapuys heard that Henry was
negotiating with the German Princes, and offering
his daughter Mary to the young Duke of Cleves, in
order to prevent him from marrying the Duchess.
"He is so much in love," wrote Castillon, "that for
one gracious word from her I believe he would go to
war to recover Denmark."<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>The same week Henry wrote to Wyatt, complaining
bitterly of the treatment which he had received
from his imperial brother, as being wholly unworthy
of a Prince who professed to be his zealous friend.
"After so hot a summer we saw never so cold a
winter; after all these professions of love and friendship,
in the end nothing but a cold frost." He ended
by declaring he would no longer be kept "hanging in
the balance," and must have an immediate answer,
even if it were a flat denial.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> At length even Charles
could procrastinate no longer, and on the 15th of
February he told Wyatt that it was impossible for
the marriage to take place without the Pope's
dispensation, as the King's dispensation would never
satisfy the Duchess herself, or any of her relations,
and might cause endless inconvenience if children
were born of the union. "All the stay," wrote
Cromwell to Wriothesley, "is upon the dispensation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>to which they object now, but whereof they never
spake before."<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p>Even before the courier from Spain arrived, Henry's
face was so black that Castillon wrote home begging
to be recalled, and declaring that this King was the
most cruel and dangerous man in the world. He was
in such a rage that he had neither reason nor understanding
left, and once he found out that Francis
could do nothing for him, Castillon was convinced
that his own life would not be worth a straw. A few
days later the Ambassador left London, and rejoiced
to find himself safely back in France.<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>


<h3>VII.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1539</span>] A GAY CARNIVAL</div>

<p>While London was full of alarms, Wriothesley and
his colleagues were spending a gay Shrovetide at
Brussels, all unconscious of the clouds that were
darkening the horizon. During the last few weeks
nobles and courtiers had vied with each other in
paying them attentions. Visitors of the highest rank
honoured their humble lodgings. Madame de Berghen,
Aerschot's lively sister&mdash;"a dame of stomach
that hath a jolly tongue"&mdash;dined with them. The
Queen herself was expected to pay them a visit,
and great preparations in the way of plate and furniture
were made for her reception. Count B&uuml;ren,
a very great man in Holland, was particularly
friendly, and impressed Wriothesley so much by his
honesty and loyalty that he gave him the best horse
in his stables. Another day he entertained the Captain
of Gravelines, who railed against the abominations of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>Rome to his heart's content, and told him it would be
the Pope's fault if the King's marriage were not concluded.
Carnival week brought a round of festivities.
On Monday, the 17th of February, the Ambassadors
were invited to meet the Queen at supper at the Duke
of Aerschot's house, and were received at half-past five
by the Duchess and her sister-in-law, Madame de
Berghen. The Duchess sent for her young daughter
and her two sons&mdash;boys of ten and twelve&mdash;and
presently they were joined by Monsieur de V&eacute;ly, the
new French Ambassador. Wriothesley expressed great
pleasure at meeting him, saying that, since their
masters were good friends, they ought not to be
strangers, and received a cordial reply. The rest of
the company looked on with some surprise at these
friendly fashions, a rumour being abroad that the
French King was about to attack England and force
Henry to submit to the Pope. Then a flourish of
trumpets, sackbuts, and fifes, was heard at the gates,
and the guests rose as the Queen and Duchess entered
the hall. At supper the French Ambassador sat on
the Queen's right, and Wriothesley on her left, while
Christina was between him and Vaughan. Madame
d'Egmont sat next to Dr. Carne, and the Prince of
Orange was on the Duchess of Aerschot's right hand.
Mary made herself very agreeable to both her neighbours,
and when, after supper, her chapel choir
sang roundelays and merry drinking-songs, she asked
Wriothesley if he were fond of music, and invited
him to sup with her on the morrow and hear her
minstrels. The Ambassador confessed that he was
very fond of music, and often had some at his poor
home to cheer his dull spirits. "Well, it is an honest
pastime," said the Queen, "and maketh good diges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>tion,
for it driveth thoughts away." Here Wriothesley
ventured to remark that he would feel merrier
if he had not wasted so much time here, and asked
if there was still no news from Spain. "None,"
replied the Queen; and Wriothesley observed that
reports reached him from Germany that the Emperor
was merely trying to gain time, and meant to do
the Bishop of Rome's bidding. "Jesus!" exclaimed
the Queen, "I dare say the Emperor never meant
such a thing;" upon which Wriothesley hastened to
say that he felt sure the Emperor was too wise and
honourable a Prince to deceive the King, but now
that he had made friends with his old enemy, he
hoped he would not make a new enemy of his old
friend. After supper the Duke and several ladies
came in, wearing masks and rich costumes, and threw
dice with the Queen and her niece for some fine diamonds,
which the Princesses won. Then the Prince
of Orange led out Christina to dance, and the other
youthful guests followed suit, while Wriothesley sat
at the Queen's side on the da&iuml;s and watched the
princely pair.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1539</span>] AN UNPLEASANT SURPRISE</div>

<p>The next evening (Shrove Tuesday) Wriothesley
and his colleagues dined at the palace, and this time
the English Ambassador sat in the post of honour,
on the Queen's right, with the Duchess on his left.
Mary was in high spirits, toasted her guests and
drank with each of them in turn. After supper
Wriothesley approached Christina, and ventured to
tell her that she would be happy if her best friends
did not put hindrances in her way, and begged her
not to lend ear to malicious reports of his master.
The Duchess shook her head, saying she would listen
to no calumnies, and always hold the King to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
noble Prince. But he felt sure that she was afraid
of the Queen, and told her he hoped to converse more
freely with her another time. Never had he seen
her look so beautiful as she did that night; never did
he wish more ardently to see her his master's bride.
"For indeed it were pity," he wrote home, "if she
were bestowed on a husband she did not like, only to
serve others."</p>

<p>There was one Prince at table for whom, it was easy
to see, Christina had no dislike. This was Ren&eacute; of
Orange, who had an opportunity of distinguishing
himself in his lady's eyes that evening. The Queen
led the way into the great hall, where first Aerschot
and three other nobles challenged all comers to fight,
and then the Prince of Orange and Floris d'Egmont
took their places at the barriers, and broke lances
and received prizes for their valour, while the Queen's
band of lutes, viols, and rebecks, played the finest
music that Wriothesley had ever heard. When the
jousting was ended, Mary led her guests to the royal
gallery, where another banquet was served, and there
was much lively discourse, and more talking than
eating. So that gay Carnival came to a close, and
with it the last hope of winning the fair Duchess's
hand.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p>An unpleasant surprise was in store for Wriothesley
the next morning. Certain disquieting rumours
having reached Brussels, Vaughan went to Antwerp
on Ash Wednesday, and found great consternation
among the English merchants. A proclamation
had been issued forbidding any ships to leave the
port, and several English vessels laden with merchandise
had been detained. The wildest rumours were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
current on the Exchange. It was commonly said
that the Emperor, with the Kings of France and
Scotland, had declared war on King Henry, and that
a large Dutch and Spanish fleet was about to sail
for England. Already in Brussels gallants and pikemen
were taking bets on the issue of the war, and
Wriothesley wrote to Cromwell that he and his
colleagues "might peradventure broil on a faggot."
He was unable to obtain an audience until Friday,
when the Queen told him that, by the Emperor's
orders, she was recalling Chapuys to conduct the
marriage negotiations. This unexpected intimation,
coming as it did after the startling news from Antwerp,
disconcerted him considerably. He sent an
express to London, and received orders to take his
departure at once. Castillon was already on his way
to France, but Henry quite refused to let Chapuys
go until Wriothesley and Vaughan had left Brussels.
A long wrangle between the two Courts followed.
The Ambassadors were detained on both sides. The
Spanish and Dutch ships in English harbours were
stopped, all ports were closed, and active preparations
were made for war along the shores of the
Channel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"After fair weather," wrote Cromwell to Wriothesley,
"there is succeeded a weather very cloudy.
Good words, good countenance, be turned, we perceive,
to a wonderful strangeness. But let that pass.
They can do us no harm but to their own detriment."<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1539</span>] STRANGE ENTERTAINMENT</div>

<p>The situation of the Ambassadors was by no means
pleasant. A marked change was visible in the behaviour
of the Court. They were "treated as very
strangers" by those nobles who had been their best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>friends. No one called at their house or came to
dine with them. The Duchess's servants, who used
to go to and fro constantly, now dared not come
except at dusk&mdash;"in the owl-flight"&mdash;and would not
allow Wriothesley to send them home by torchlight.
Wherever they went, the English heard their King
slandered, and met with cold looks and scornful
words. Worse than all, they were forced to pay
excise duties&mdash;"eighteen pence on every barrel of beer
above the price asked by the brewer"&mdash;an indignity
to which no Ambassador before had ever been
exposed. "I write in haste and live in misery,"
wrote Wriothesley to Cromwell on the 7th of March.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p>The Emperor, however, was still friendly. His
heart was set on a Crusade against the Turk, and he
had no wish to embark on war with England. Pole
met with a cold reception at Toledo, and, finding
Charles averse to executing the Pope's sentence,
retired to his friend Sadoleto's house at Carpentras.
This was a relief to Henry, and he bade Wyatt thank
his imperial brother, but could not forbear pointing
out that these friendly words agreed ill with the
doings of his officers in the Low Countries. A
despatch addressed to Wyatt on the 10th of March
contains a long recital of the extraordinary treatment
which his Ambassadors at Brussels had met with:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Since Lent began, as for a penance, their entertainment
hath been marvellous strange&mdash;yea, and
stranger than we will rehearse: strangeness in having
audience with long delay, strangeness in answer and
fashion. Also they have been constrained to pay
Excise, which no Ambassador of England paid in any
man's remembrance. They have complained to the
Queen, but nevertheless must pay or lack drink....
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>These rumours and hints of war, the arrest of our
ships, this strangeness shown to our Ministers, this
navy and army in readiness, the recall of Chapuys,
ran abroad this realm and everywhere. We do not
write to you the rumours half so spiteful, and the
entertainment half so strange, as it hath been. I
think never such a thing was heard, and especially
after a treaty of marriage such a banquet!"<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p></div>

<p>Henry concluded this letter by saying that, since
the Emperor insisted on the need of Papal dispensation,
there could be no further question of any
marriage between him and the Duchess, and he
would be now at liberty to seek another wife. On
the same day he wrote to Carne, who had been secretly
corresponding with the Duke of Cleves, telling him
to open negotiations for a marriage with that Prince's
sister, the Lady Anne.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

<p>Twelve days after this despatch was sent to Spain
Wriothesley left Brussels. At Calais he met Chapuys,
who had just crossed the Channel, and Mary's
almoner, the Dean of Cambray, who was being sent
to take the Ambassador's place, and was awaiting
a fair wind to embark for Dover. All three
Ambassadors dined in a friendly manner with Lord
Lisle, the Deputy Governor of Calais, and continued
their respective journeys without hindrance. But
the much-discussed marriage treaty was at an end.
The long-drawn comedy had reached its last act.
"All hope of the Duchess," wrote Wriothesley to
Cromwell, "is utterly past."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1539</span>] A WELSHMAN'S OPINION</div>

<p>The rupture was loudly lamented by the English
merchants in Antwerp, and keen disappointment was
felt throughout England, where the marriage had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>always been popular. Among many scattered notices
of the feeling which prevailed on the subject, the
following incident is of especial interest, because of
the sidelight which it throws on Christina's personal
reluctance to the marriage.</p>

<p>On a summer evening in August, 1539, five months
after Wriothesley left Brussels, a married priest
named George Constantyne, of Llan Hawaden in
South Wales, rode from Chepstow to Abergavenny
with John Barlow, Dean of Westbury. The priest
had got into trouble in Wolsey's time, for buying
copies of Tyndale's New Testament, and was forced
to fly the country and practise as a physician for
several years in the Netherlands. Now he had returned
to England, and was on his way to his old
home in Wales. He walked from Bristol to Westbury,
where he supped with Dean Barlow, a brother of his
friend the Bishop of St. Davids, who made him heartily
welcome, and invited him to be his travelling companion
the next day to Pembrokeshire. As the
two ecclesiastics rode through the green valleys on
the way to Abergavenny, the Dean asked Constantyne
if he could tell him why the King's marriage had
been so long delayed. The priest replied that he,
for his part, was very sorry the King should still be
without a wife, when he might by this time have been
the father of fair children. As the Dean knew, both
the Duchess of Milan and she of Cleves were spoken of,
and now the little doctor, Nicholas Wotton, had been
sent to Cleves with Mr. Beard, of the Privy Chamber,
and the King's painter; so there was good hope of a
marriage being concluded with the Duke of Cleves,
who favoured God's word, and was a mighty Prince
now, holding Guelderland against the Emperor's will.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
But why, asked the Dean, was the marriage with the
Duchess of Milan broken off? Constantyne, who
was familiar with all the gossip of the Regent's Court,
replied that the Duchess quite refused to marry the
King, unless he would accept the Bishop of Rome's
dispensation, and give pledges that her life would be
safe and her honour respected. "Why pledges?"
asked the Dean innocently. "Marry!" returned
Constantyne, "she sayeth that, since the King's
Majesty was in so little space rid of three Queens, she
dare not trust his Council, even if she dare trust His
Majesty. For in Flanders the nobles suspect that
her great-aunt, Queen Catherine, was poisoned,
that Anne Boleyn was innocent of the crimes for
which she was put to death, and that the third wife,
Queen Jane, was lost for lack of attention in childbed."
Such, at least, were the mutterings which
he heard at Court before Whitsuntide. The Dean
remarked that he was afraid the affair of Milan must
be dashed, as Dr. Petre, who was to have gone to
fetch the royal bride from Calais, was at the Court of
St. James's last Sunday; upon which Constantyne gave
it as his opinion that there could be no amity between
the King and the Emperor, whose god was the Pope.</p>

<p>So the two men talked as they rode over the
Welsh hills on the pleasant summer evening. But
the poor priest had good reason to regret that he had
ever taken this ride; for his false friend the Dean
reported him as a Sacramentary to the Lord Privy
Seal, and a few days after he reached Llan Hawaden
he was arrested and thrown into the Tower, where he
spent several months in prison as a penalty for his
freedom of speech.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

pictures at Westminster in 1542 and 1547 as "No. 12. A greate
Table with the picture of the Duchess of Myllane, being her
whole stature." After Henry's death it passed into the hands
of Fitzalan, Earl of Arundel, the King's Lord Chamberlain and
godson, who married Lady Katherine Grey, and acquired the
Palace of Nonsuch, with most of its contents. When he died,
in 1580, it became the property, first of his elder daughter Jane,
wife of Lord Lumley, and then of her great-nephew, Thomas
Howard, Earl of Arundel. This great collector took the Duchess
of Milan's portrait with him abroad during the Civil Wars, and
after his death, in 1645, it hung, with many other Holbeins, in
the house of his widow at Amsterdam. Lady Arundel left the
whole collection to her son, Henry Howard, who became the sixth
Duke of Norfolk, and Holbein's portrait remained in the family
until, in 1909, it was acquired by the National Gallery for the
sum of &pound;72,000. A second portrait of the Duchess of Milan, a
half-length, is mentioned in Henry VIII.'s Catalogues ("No. 138.
A Table with a picture of the Duchess of Myllane"), and was discovered
by Sir George Scharf in a waiting-room near the private
chapel at Windsor. This is probably the portrait by Van Orley
which Hutton sent to England before Holbein's arrival at Brussels.
The attitude of the sitter, her dress and features, are the same
as in Holbein's picture, but the face is less finely modelled and
lacks charm and expression. The hands are in a slightly different
position, and instead of one big ruby ring she wears three rings&mdash;a
cameo and a gold ring on the right hand, and a black ring, the
badge of widowhood, on the third finger of the left hand. This
curious and interesting portrait is plainly the work of an inferior
artist, and, as the Ambassador justly remarked, bears no comparison
with Holbein's Duchess&mdash;"surely," in the words of his
biographer, "one of the most precious pictures in the world"
(Wornum's "Life of Holbein," p. 322; L. Cust in the <i>Burlington
Magazine</i>, August, 1911, p. 278; and Sir G. Scharf in "Arch&aelig;ologia,"
xl. 205).</p></div>

visit to Joinville, owing to a mistake in the Calendar
of State Papers (xiii. 1, 130), where Cromwell's instructions
to Hoby for his journeys to Brussels and France are entered
under the date of February, 1538. But the Duchess of Guise's
letter (see Appendix), as well as the payment of &pound;10 made by
Sir Brian Tuke, Treasurer of the Household, to Hans Holbein on
the 30th of December, 1538, "for going to the parts of High
Burgony about certain of the King's business," make it clear
that this journey took place at the end of August (G. Scharf,
"Arch&aelig;ologia," xxxix. 7). From Lorraine the painter went on
to B&acirc;le, where he spent some months, and returned to England
at Christmas. The original documents in the British Museum
(Additional Manuscripts, 5,498, f. 1) bear no date, and are on
separate sheets, and the heading of the instructions regarding
the journey to Brussels was added by a later hand, and is thus
worded: "Instructions given by the L. Cromwell to Philip Hoby,
sent over by him to the Duchess of Lorraine, then Duchess of
Milan"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, Christina, Duchess of Lorraine, at that time Duchess
of Milan. But the editor of the Calendars inserted the words
"to the" between "then" and "Duchess of Milan," thus making
it appear that Hoby went first to Lorraine, and then to the Duchess
of Milan, whereas the journey to Brussels took place in March,
and that to Lorraine in August. Since this chapter was written,
the subject has been fully dealt with by Mr. A. B. Chamberlain
in the <i>Burlington Magazine</i>, April, 1912.</p></div>

<h2>BOOK VII<br />

CLEVES, ORANGE, AND LORRAINE<br />

1539-1541</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The negotiations for the King of England's marriage
with the Duchess of Milan were broken off. But
there was no lack of suitors for Christina's hand.
During the winter and spring of 1539 the Emperor's
niece received offers of marriage from three princely
bridegrooms. The first of these was Antoine, Duke
of Vend&ocirc;me, whose courtship of the Duchess on the
journey to Compi&egrave;gne had aroused King Henry's
jealousy. The second was William of Cleves, who
since the old Duke Charles's death had taken possession
of Guelders, and was now seeking to obtain the
investiture of the duchy, together with Christina's
hand. The third was Francis, the Marquis of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson,
and heir of Lorraine. From the day that
this Prince first met the Duchess at Compi&egrave;gne, he
sought her for his bride with a constancy and steadfastness
that were eventually to be crowned with
success. But for the moment the Duke of Cleves
seemed to have the best chance of winning the coveted
prize. From the first Mary of Hungary had regarded
this alliance with favour, and when, in January, 1539,
she consulted her Councillors on the Duchess's mar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>riage,
it was this union which met with their highest
approval.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Duke William," wrote the Queen in her reply to
the Emperor, "has greatly offended Your Majesty,
both as a private individual and sovereign lord, by
taking possession of Guelders. Still, as he renews his
suit and professes to be your loyal friend and servant,
it would be well to treat with him and offer him the
Duchess's hand, on condition that he will give up
Guelderland."<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a></p></div>

<p>The alternative proposal, she proceeded to say,
deserved consideration, seeing the great anxiety
which the Duke of Lorraine's son showed for the
marriage. No doubt the Emperor's niece, with her
large dowry, would be a very honourable match for
him, and well worth the surrender of his rights on
Guelders; but, since it was most desirable to recover
this duchy without delay, it might be well to secure
the help of Lorraine by this means.</p>

<p>The situation was a difficult one, and from the
moment of the old Duke's death in June, 1538, Mary
had never ceased to entreat Charles to come to
Flanders and take active measures for the recovery of
Guelders before it was too late. Throughout the
winter Duke William went from town to town, endearing
himself to his new subjects; and when the
deputies of Lorraine asserted their master's superior
claims, he told them that he would never give up
Guelders to any mortal man. By the death of his
father on the 6th of February, 1539, he succeeded to
the rich provinces of Cleves and J&uuml;lich, and became
the wealthiest and most powerful Prince in North
Germany.<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1539</span>] ANNE OF CLEVES</div>

<p>Still Charles put off his coming, and told his sister
that he was bent on undertaking a second Crusade
against the Turks, and could not spare the time for
a journey to Flanders. This was too much for Mary's
equanimity, and she protested in the strongest language
against the Emperor's folly in exposing his person to
such risks, declaring that this Crusade would not only
prove the utter ruin of the Netherlands, but of all
Christendom.<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> Fortunately, Mary's remonstrances
were supported by the Emperor's wisest Councillors,
and, in deference to their representations, he decided
to abandon his Crusade for the present and come to
Flanders. This decision was confirmed by the discontent
which the Duke of Cleves's intrigues helped to
foment in Ghent&mdash;always a turbulent city&mdash;as well
as by the news that the King of England had entered
into a close alliance with Cleves, and was about to
marry his sister.</p>

<p>Cromwell, with his habitual duplicity, had been in
correspondence with the German Princes while he
professed to be zealous for the Emperor's alliance;
and in March Christopher Mont, his Envoy to Frankfort,
was desired to make diligent inquiries as to the
shape, stature, and complexion, of the Duke of Cleves's
sister Anne. If these were satisfactory, he was to
suggest that proposals of marriage should be made
by that Prince and his brother-in-law, the Elector
John Frederick of Saxony. Mont sent glowing descriptions
of the lady's beauty, and was bold enough
to declare that she excelled the Duchess of Milan as
much as the golden sun excels the silver moon.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry was now all on fire to see the Lady Anne,
although he had not yet lost all interest in Christina,
whose name still figures constantly in letters from
Brussels. On the 6th of April we hear that the
Duchess of Milan is sick of fever, and ten days later
Cromwell writes to the King that Her Grace is no
longer sick, and that "at Antwerp the people still
cherish a hope that Your Highness will yet marry
her."<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> If he could not make her his wife, the King
was determined to prevent another suitor from succeeding
where he had failed, and renewed his offer of
his daughter Mary with a large dowry to the Duke of
Cleves. William, however, showed no alacrity to avail
himself of this offer, and sent Envoys both to Brussels
and Toledo to press his suit for Christina's hand.</p>

<p>The sudden death of the Empress at Toledo on the
1st of May altered all Charles's plans. A few weeks
before this Isabella had given birth to a son, who
only lived a few hours, and Charles had written to
inform his sister of the infant's death. On the 2nd of
May he wrote a few touching lines with his own hand
to tell Mary the grievous news. The doctors had
pronounced her to be out of danger, but catarrh
attacked the lungs, and proved fatal in a few hours.</p>

<p>When this sad event took place, Christina's sister
Dorothea and her husband, Count Frederic, were
staying at the Imperial Court. These adventurous
travellers had come to Spain in the vain hope of inducing
the Emperor to support their claims on Denmark,
and, after crossing the Pyrenees in rain and snow, had
at length reached Toledo, where they were hospitably
entertained. The Empress treated Dorothea with
great affection, but Frederic's German servants, who
consumed five meals a day and ate meat on Ash
Wednesday, shocked the Spanish courtiers, and drew
down the censures of the Inquisition upon them.
Even the Emperor asked his cousin why he brought
so numerous a suite on his travels; but, although he
would make no promises of further help, he good-naturedly
paid Frederic's expenses at Toledo, and
gave him a present of 7,000 crowns. The death of
the Empress, Dorothea's best friend, put an end to all
hope of further assistance. The Emperor shut himself
up in a Carthusian convent, and the Palatine and
his wife started for the Low Countries.<a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> On their
way through France they were royally entertained
by the King and Queen in the splendid Palais des
Tournelles, and Francis took so great a fancy to his
wife's niece that Eleanor felt it wise to keep Dorothea
continually at her side. Here they were detained some
time by Frederic's illness, and after his recovery spent
several days at Chantilly with the Constable, and at
the King's fine new villa of Cotterets, on their way to
the Netherlands.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1539</span>] A MOCK FIGHT</div>

<p>Here the travellers were eagerly awaited by Christina
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>and her aunt. After the funeral services for
the repose of the Empress's soul had been duly celebrated,
and the last requiem sung in S. Gudule, the
Queen set out on a progress through Holland and
Friesland, and spent some time at Bois-le-Duc, on the
frontiers of Guelders, trying to arrange matters with
the Duke of Cleves. But, although friendly letters
and messages were exchanged, nothing could be
settled until the Emperor's arrival, which was now
delayed till the autumn, and the Court moved to the
Hague for August. Here the Queen received news
that the Count Palatine and his wife had reached
Dordrecht and were coming by sea to Holland.
Christina at once travelled to Rotterdam, intending
to go by boat to meet the travellers. But the
weather was rough and stormy, and the sailors were
reluctant to set out. The Duchess, however, would
hear of no delay, and, embarking in a small boat,
bade the sailors put out to sea. Hardly had they left
the shore before a terrific gale sprang up, and from
the deck of their ship the Palatine and his wife saw
a barque tossed on the raging seas, sending up signals
of distress. Altering their course, they hastened to
the rescue, and found, to their great surprise, that
the Duchess of Milan was on board. Count Frederic
scolded his sister-in-law soundly for her rashness, but
Dorothea was enchanted to see Christina, and laughed
and cried by turn as she embraced her.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The Queen
awaited the travellers no less eagerly, in her anxiety
to hear the latest news from Spain, and agreed readily
to Frederic's proposal that his wife should remain at
the Hague while he returned to Germany. Early in
September the Palatine took leave of his relatives and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>went to Antwerp, saying that he must raise money for
his journey to Heidelberg. But he kept his true destination
a secret. During his illness in Paris, Bishop
Bonner had brought Frederic a letter from Cromwell,
begging him to come to England, since he was only
divided from this country by a narrow arm of the
sea, and His Majesty was very anxious to see him
again. All immediate alarm of war had died away,
and the irascible monarch's anger was allayed by the
arrival of a new French Ambassador in the person of
Marillac, and by the permission which Mary gave him
to buy ammunition in the Low Countries. In return,
he ordered an imposing requiem to be held in St.
Paul's for the late Empress, and desired Cromwell
and the Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk, with twenty
Bishops, to attend the service.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> He resumed his old
habit of spending the summer evenings on the river,
enjoying the music of flutes and harps, and sent to
France and Italy for excellent painters and musicians&mdash;a
sure sign, Marillac was told, that he was about
to marry again. Another f&ecirc;te, at which the Ambassador
declined to be present, was a mock-fight on the
Thames between two galleys, one of which bore the
King's arms, while the other was decorated with an
effigy of the Pope with the triple tiara and keys,
attended by the Cardinals. The show ended in the
triumph of the English sailors, who threw the Pope
and Cardinals into the river&mdash;"the whole thing,"
according to Marillac, "being as badly represented
as it was poorly conceived."<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p>Now the King was anxious to hear the Emperor's
intention from the Palatine's own lips, while Frederic
on his part was flattered by this powerful monarch's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>invitation, and felt that his assistance might prove
of use in his visionary schemes for the recovery of
Denmark. But, knowing that of late relations between
Henry and the Queen had been strained, he
kept his counsel, and told no one but his wife that he
was bound for Calais.</p>

<p>Here he was courteously entertained by Lord Lisle,
an illegitimate son of Edward IV., and escorted by
him to Canterbury and London. Frederic was lost
in admiration at the rows of stately palaces along the
Thames, and the fine Castle of Richmond, but was
disappointed, when he visited Westminster Abbey,
not to see the famous antlers of the stag which King
Dagobert caught, and which wore a golden collar
inscribed with the words, "Julius C&aelig;sar let me go
free." Afterwards he learnt that these legendary
trophies had lately been removed by the King's
orders, for fear the monks, whom he was about to
expel, might conceal them.</p>

<p>In the absence of the King at Ampthill, Cromwell,
who had been told to "grope out the reason of
Frederic's coming," entertained the Count splendidly
at his own house, and showed him the Tower of
London and the Temple Church. But the Deputy's
wife, Lady Lisle, who looked on Cromwell with deep
distrust, begged her husband to beware of the Lord
Privy Seal's fair words, and was none too well pleased
to hear that he had partaken of the partridge pasty
and baked cranes which she had sent from Calais,
together with her own toothpick for the Palsgrave's
use, having noticed that her noble guest "used a quill
to pick his teeth with."<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1539</span>] THE PALATINE AT WINDSOR</div>

<p>Meanwhile the Palatine's visit to England was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>exciting much curiosity, and not a little alarm, in some
quarters. The Pope and the French King feared it
might lead to a secret covenant between Henry and
Charles, while in London it was commonly reported
that Frederic came to renew negotiations for his union
with the Duchess of Milan, and the Duke of Cleves
hastily sent Ambassadors to conclude his sister's
marriage. These Envoys reached Windsor on the
same day as the Count Palatine, whom Henry invited
to a banquet there on the 24th of September. When
he bade the Lord High Admiral escort the Palsgrave
to Windsor, Southampton, eager to curry
favour with the King, expressed his opinion that the
Cleves alliance was preferable to a marriage with a
French Princess or one of the Emperor's family,
"albeit the Duchess of Milan was a fair woman and
well spoken of," and told the King of the resentment
which his union with the Lady Anne had aroused at
the Court of Brussels. Henry remained plunged in
thought for some moments; then a smile broke over
his face, and he exclaimed: "Have they remembered
themselves now? They that would not when they
might, when they would they shall have nay!"<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a></p>

<p>Nothing was lacking, however, to the splendour of
the Palatine's reception at Windsor. The Duke of
Suffolk rode out to meet him beyond Eton Bridge
with 100 horsemen clad in velvet, and the banquet
was served on golden dishes in a hall carpeted with
cloth of gold, to the strains of delicious music from
the King's famous band. The Cleves Envoys were
at table, but after dinner the King took the Count
apart, and conversed with him for over two hours on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
his travels. Frederic took this opportunity of begging
the King to help him in driving out the usurper of
Denmark, and releasing his unhappy father-in-law,
Christian II.<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> Henry listened kindly, and promised
to consider the matter, but no mention was made of
Christina. The next day a great hunting-party was
given in the Palsgrave's honour. A pavilion of green
laurel boughs was set up in a meadow on the banks
of the river, and while the King and his guests were
at dinner the merry note of hunting-horns rang
through the air, and a stag bounded across the turf,
followed by the hounds at full cry. Immediately the
whole party sprang to horse and joined in the chase,
which lasted for three hours, and ended in the
slaughter of thirty-four stags. From Windsor
Frederic went to Hampton Court, and on the 3rd of
October finally took leave of the King, who gave him
2,000 crowns as a parting gift. Hubert also received
a silver cup from the Lord Privy Seal, who begged
him and his lord to return at Christmas, and surprised
him by asking if the Palsgrave had any castle to let
or sell, as it might be convenient for him to secure a
retreat abroad. The Minister evidently realized the
precarious nature of his position, and Hubert remembered
his request when he heard of the doom which
soon afterwards overtook the King's favourite.<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1539</span>] THE LADY ANNE</div>

<p>In his last interview Henry told the Count that he
feared it would be impossible for him to join in any
enterprise against Denmark, as his new allies the
German Princes were in league with the present King.
At the same time he informed his good cousin of his
intended marriage to the Lady Anne of Cleves, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>Princess of suitable age and elegant stature, and
begged him to obtain a safe-conduct from the Regent
for his bride's passage through the Low Countries.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
The next day Frederic crossed the Channel and joined
his wife at Brussels. Here, as Dorothea had already
told him, he found the Queen much displeased at the
trick which he had played her, and Hubert came in
for his share of blame. They soon left Brabant for
Heidelberg, and the Palatine sent Lady Lisle&mdash;or, as
he called her, "Madame ma bonne m&egrave;re"&mdash;a barrel
of fine red and white Rhine wine in remembrance "of
her loving son."<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>King Henry's marriage to Anne of Cleves, as
Southampton told his master, was exceedingly unpopular
in the Netherlands. The alliance of so
powerful a monarch with Duke William was fraught
with danger, and the people bitterly resented the
insult which, in their eyes, had been offered to the
Duchess of Milan. The merchants of Antwerp said
openly that, if King Henry chose to break faith with
their Princess, he should not enjoy the company of
another wife, and declared they would not allow the
Lady Anne to pass through their city. The Cleves
Envoys in England were so much alarmed by these
reports that they travelled back to D&uuml;ren in disguise,
and advised the bride to take the sea-route from
Germany. But Mary of Hungary was too wise to
show her annoyance, and sent a gracious message to
Henry, saying that she would send Count B&uuml;ren
to wait on the Lady Anne, on her journey through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>Emperor's dominions. The King wrote back in high
glee to thank "his dearest sister," and on the 27th of
December his new bride landed safely at Dover.<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
The loyal citizens of Flanders consoled themselves with
the thought that, if their Duchess was not to be Queen
of England, they would keep her among them, and
the old rumour was persistently repeated: "She shall
marry the Prince of Orange." All through the past
year Ren&eacute; had devoted himself to Christina's service,
had worn her favours and broken lances in her honour.
Her Italian servants called him openly the Duchess's
<i>cavaliere sirvente</i>.<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> But it was plain to Italians and
Flemings alike that the affection was not at all on
one side, and that this gallant Prince had won Christina's
heart. Old courtiers smiled kindly on the
young couple, and ladies drew aside discreetly to
leave them together. They were eminently fitted
for each other by age, race and character. If the
succession to the principality of Orange, which had
been lately restored by the French King, hardly entitled
Ren&eacute; to a place among the reigning Princes of
Europe, at least he could offer her splendid homes
at Brussels and Breda, and a position which many
ladies of royal birth might envy. The Countess
Palatine Dorothea privately encouraged the Prince,
and her husband warmly approved of the match, and
said openly that, since his sister-in-law could not be
King Henry's wife, she had better marry the man of
her choice, and not waste the best years of her life,
as he himself had done.<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1539</span>] THE REVOLT OF GHENT</div>

<p>Queen Mary was, clearly, not averse to the Prince's
suit, and had a strong liking for Ren&eacute;; but reasons of
State prevented her from giving the union her public
sanction, and all parties were agreed that nothing
could be arranged until the Emperor's arrival. The
date of his journey was now definitely fixed, and
in November Mary told the English Ambassador
Vaughan that her brother would be at Brussels by
the New Year. Charles at length realized the critical
situation of affairs, and saw that if he wished to keep
his provinces <i>de par-de&ccedil;a</i> he must no longer delay his
coming.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> In September, 1539, the citizens of Ghent,
who had long been discontented, broke into open
revolt. After refusing to pay their share of the
subsidy voted by the States, the leading citizens
put to death their chief magistrate, Lieven Pyl,
because he declined to bear their insolent message to
the Regent, and proceeded to tear up the famous
"Calf-vel," a parchment deed containing an agreement
which they had made with Charles V. twenty-four
years before. Worse than all, they sent deputies
to King Francis, asking him to defend their liberties
against the Emperor. At the first tidings of these
disorders Mary hastened to Malines and took energetic
measures to suppress the insurrection, which had
already spread to several of the neighbouring towns.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a>
For some weeks the alarm was great, and watchers
were posted on the tower of S. Rombaut night and
day; but the Queen's presence of mind, and the
support of her able lieutenants, Aerschot and De
Courri&egrave;res, who was now Bailiff of Alost, succeeded
in confining the mutiny to the walls of Ghent. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>simultaneous rising at Maestricht was put down by
the Prince of Orange, who raised 300 horse and
hastened to restore order in that city. But the
citizens of Ghent still openly defied the Regent,
although Francis, to do him credit, refused to help
the rebels. More than this, he addressed a letter
with his own royal hand to Charles, saying that, if the
Emperor was coming to chastise his revolted subjects,
he hoped that he would do him the honour of passing
through France, assuring him, on the faith of a
Prince, that every possible honour and hospitality
would be shown him.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a></p>

<p>So critical was the situation, both with regard to
Ghent and Guelders, that Charles decided to accept
the offer and take the shortest route to Flanders.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My good brother the Emperor," wrote Francis
to his Ambassador in England, "is coming to visit
me on his way to the Low Countries, a thing which
not only does me the greatest honour, content, and
pleasure, but is a proof of the good and perfect friendship
between us."</p></div>

<p>He expressed the same feelings in still stronger
terms to Wyatt, whom Cromwell sent to Blois in
December to be present at the meeting of the two
monarchs.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Emperor," he added, "is doing me the greatest
honour that can be, by coming to visit me, and
showing thereby that he taketh me for an honest
man."<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1539</span>] A SPLENDID RECEPTION</div>

<p>On the 23rd of November Charles left Burgos, and
four days later he entered Bayonne, attended by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>Dauphin and the Constable Montmorency, whom
the King had sent to meet him on the frontier. He
had begged Francis to dispense with ceremonies, as
his great object was to reach Flanders as quickly as
possible, and to excuse him from entering on political
matters, since he could not decide anything of importance
until he had seen the Queen-Regent.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> But,
in spite of this request, he was everywhere received
with the utmost pomp and festivity. Triumphal
arches were erected at the city gates, and the prison
doors were thrown open at his entrance. Bordeaux
presented him with 300 barrels of wine, Poitiers gave
him a golden eagle, Orleans a dinner-service of richly
chased plate. The meeting of the two monarchs
took place at Loches on the 10th of December.
Charles, clad in deep mourning, walked under a
canopy of cloth of gold, adorned with the imperial
eagles, across the picturesque court to the gates of the
castle, where King Francis met him, surrounded by a
brilliant company. Three times over he embraced
his guest, and led him to the hall, where Eleanor, in
robes of purple satin glittering with pearls, welcomed
her brother with transports of joy. Banquets and
hunting-parties now followed each other, as the Court
journeyed by slow stages along the banks of the Loire,
from one fair ch&acirc;teau to another. At Amboise a heap
of tow caught fire as Charles rode up the famous spiral
staircase in the dusk, and he narrowly escaped being
suffocated. But, mercifully, no one was injured, and
Francis escorted his imperial brother by way of Blois
and Orleans to Fontainebleau, where Christmas was
spent and the Emperor was allowed to enjoy a week's
rest. On New Year's Day the Emperor entered Paris,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>where the Parliament and University received him
"as if he were a god from heaven," and the following
motto was inscribed on the gates in golden letters:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ouvre, Paris, ouvre tes hautes portes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entrer y veut le plus grand des Chr&eacute;tiens."<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Queen Eleanor, who scarcely left her brother's
side, took him to see the <i>Sainte Chapelle</i> which St.
Louis had built to receive the Crown of Thorns, and
escorted him to the Louvre, where sumptuous rooms
had been prepared for his reception. On Sunday
a grand tournament was held on the Place des Tournelles,
in front of the palace which then occupied the
Place des Vosges, and the Duke of Vend&ocirc;me and
the Count of Aumale opened the joust, while it was
closed by Francis of Lorraine, the Marquis of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson.
Charles left Paris on the 7th of January,
and was presented by the city with a silver model
of the Column of Hercules, seven feet high, bearing
his motto, <i>Plus oultre</i>.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> The King took his guest to
dine at his new pleasure-house, the Ch&acirc;teau de
Madrid, accompanied him to St. Denis, where he
visited the Tomb of the Kings, and went on to the
Constable's house at Chantilly. Finally, on the 20th,
the Emperor took his leave of the King and Queen
at St. Quentin, and with tears in his eyes thanked
his host for this truly brotherly reception.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1540</span>] THE CALENDAR OF FOOLS</div>

<p>In spite of the sinister warnings which Charles had
received before he set out on his journey, in
spite of Mary of Hungary's fears and of Madame
d'&Eacute;tampes' thinly-veiled hostility, the experiment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>had proved a brilliant success. Spanish and French
poets celebrated the triumph of Peace over War,
and the return of the golden age. And Charles himself
laughed heartily when the King's jester, Triboulet,
told him that he had inscribed His Imperial Majesty's
name on his Calendar of Fools, because he had been
so rash as to venture into his enemy's country, but
now that he had reached the end of his journey without
mishap, he should rub out Charles's name, and
write that of Francis in its place.<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a></p>

<p>The French King went home in high delight, and
wrote to Marillac saying that now all his differences
with the Emperor would be easily arranged. During
those five weeks the King had respected his guest's
wishes and avoided politics, but the Constable, who
enjoyed the Emperor's confidence in a high degree,
had made good use of this opportunity, and flattered
himself that he had been entirely successful. He
was above all anxious to effect a marriage between
the widowed Emperor and the King's daughter, and
told Granvelle that Madame Marguerite was a
rose among thorns, an angel among devils, and that,
if His Imperial Majesty thought of making a second
marriage, he could not do better. But Charles was
firmly resolved never to take another wife, and,
when the Constable pressed the point after he had
left France, wrote that he must beg the King to give
up all idea of such a union, as he did not intend to
marry again, and was too old for Madame Marguerite.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1539-41] A COURTLY FAREWELL</div>

<p>In spite of the splendour and cordiality of his
reception, Charles was sad and tired, and longed more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>than all else to find himself among his kindred and
people. It was with heartfelt relief that he reached
Cambray, and found the Prince of Orange, the Duke
of Aerschot, and his faithful De Courri&egrave;res, with the
Archers' Guard, awaiting him. The next day he
went on to Valenciennes, where his loyal subjects
welcomed his return with passionate joy. Triumphal
arches adorned the streets, and the houses were
hung with tapestries. Now it was his turn to act as
host, and do honour to the Dauphin and Duke of
Orleans, who, with Vend&ocirc;me, the Constable, and
Aumale, the Duke of Guise's eldest son, had insisted
on escorting him across the frontier.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> The keys of
the city were presented to the Dauphin at the Cambray
gate, torches blazed all along the streets, and
the bells rang merry peals as Charles led the way to
the ancient h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, known as La Salle, where
the Queen of Hungary and the Duchess of Milan
received him with open arms. The next two days
were given up to mirth and festivity. Charles showed
the French Princes the sights of the town, while the
Constable was invited to dine alone with the Queen
and her niece, and sat down to table between the
two royal ladies. A splendid banquet was followed
by a ball, which lasted far on into the morning.
All the ladies appeared in magnificent costumes&mdash;French,
Italian, Flemish, or Spanish, as they chose&mdash;and
wore the richest jewels. The Emperor moved
through the vast hall, blithe and debonair beyond his
wont, jesting with his old friends and rejoicing to be
once more in his native land. Mary and Christina,
both of whom, remarks the chronicler, although
widows, were still young and beautiful, danced with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>the French Princes all the evening, and were in high
spirits.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> There was much gay talk, and the Pope's
Legate, the young Cardinal Farnese, amused the
guests with stories of the latest gossip from the Court
of England, which Queen Eleanor had heard from
Marillac. According to him, the new Queen, Anne of
Cleves, was too old and ugly for King Henry's taste,
while her dresses and those of her German "Fraus"
were so monstrous that the King would not allow them
to appear at Court, and told his wife to adopt French
fashions.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a></p>

<p>The next morning the French Princes appeared
early to bid the Queen farewell, and were very gracious
in their manner of leave-taking. The Dauphin
received a superb diamond jewel in the shape of a
griffin, and a very fine emerald was bestowed on
the Constable. There was some talk of a marriage
between the Duke of Orleans and a daughter of
King Ferdinand, while the King of Navarre and his
wife, Margaret of Angoul&ecirc;me, were eager for a match
between their only daughter, Jeanne, and the Prince
of Spain. Vend&ocirc;me probably realized that he had
little chance of winning the Duchess of Milan, but he
shrugged his shoulders and went his way gaily,
saying he would wed the Pope's granddaughter,
Vittoria Farnese, the sister of the boy Cardinal.
And they all rode off in high spirits to join the King
at La F&egrave;re and show him the Emperor's costly gifts.
They met him on his way back from hunting, riding
at the side of the Queen's litter, clad in a scarlet
cloak, which made the English Ambassador remark
how much better Eleanor was treated since her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>brother's visit. And the whole Court, in Bishop
Bonner's words, "made much demonstration of
gladness, thinking they have God by the foot."<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Among all his political anxieties and preoccupations,
the Emperor had not forgotten his niece.
Before he left Spain on this perilous journey through
his old enemy's country, he drew up a paper of
instructions to be given to his son Philip in case of his
own death. A large part of this advice was devoted to
the choice of a wife for the Prince himself, the heiress
of Navarre being on the whole, in Charles's opinion,
the most eligible bride for his son. After suggesting
various alliances for his little daughters, Maria and
Juana, the Emperor proceeded to urge on his successor
the importance of finding a husband for his
niece, the Widow of Milan, saying that he counted her
as one of his own children. Three Princes, he said,
were all eager to marry her&mdash;the Duke of Cleves, the
heir of Lorraine, and the Duke of Vend&ocirc;me&mdash;but it
would be necessary to defer his decision until he
had ascertained the best measures for recovering
Denmark and settling the question of Guelders.
"And if God," he added, "should call to Himself
the Palatine Frederic, who is old and broken, one
of these Princes might marry his widow."<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Christina's
marriage, it is easy to see, was closely bound up
with the settlement of Guelders, an object which lay
very near to her uncle's heart.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1540</span>] GUELDERS</div>

<p>The English Ambassador Wyatt, who had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>posting after the Emperor across France, "through
deep and foul roads," was convinced that Charles
in his heart of hearts cared more for Guelders than he
did for all Italy. This earnest desire to recover
Guelders was, he felt sure, the true reason why the
Emperor had undertaken this long journey in the
depth of winter, and exposed his person to such great
risks in passing through France. When, contrary to
the Constable's express orders, Wyatt obtained an
audience from the Emperor at Ch&acirc;telh&eacute;rault, as he
came in from hunting with the Dauphin, and informed
him of His Majesty's marriage and alliance
with Cleves, Charles turned angrily on him, saying:</p>

<p>"What hath Monsieur de Cleves to do with
Guelders? I mean to show him that he has played
the young man. I hope the King will give him good
advice, for, I can tell you, Monsieur de Cleves shall
give me reason. I say he shall&mdash;he shall! If he
does," he continued, laying his hand on his heart,
"he shall find in me a Sovereign, a cousin, and a
neighbour. Otherwise he will lose all three."<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>When, two months later in Brussels, Wyatt craved
another interview of the Emperor, and begged him
in Henry's name to look favourably on his brother-in-law's
petition, Charles said he must desire the
King not to meddle between him and his subjects,
repeating the same words, "Je ne ferai rien," two
or three times over. An Envoy from the Duke of
Cleves came to meet him at Brussels, but was told
that the Emperor could not attend to his master's
business until the affairs of Ghent were settled. These,
as Wyatt remarked, had already quieted down in a
singular manner from the moment that the Emperor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
started on his journey, and deputies from the revolted
city had been sent to meet him at Valenciennes.
But he refused sternly to see them, saying that they
would learn his pleasure when he came to Ghent.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1540</span>] A SEVERE PUNISHMENT</div>

<p>It was Charles's intention to overawe the turbulent
city by an imposing display of armed force. On the
14th of February, 1540, he entered Ghent&mdash;"that great,
rich, and beautiful city," writes the city chronicler,
"with its broad streets, fair rivers, noble churches,
houses, and hospitals, the finest in the Netherlands"&mdash;at
the head of a stately procession. The Queen
rode on his right hand, the Duchess of Milan on his
left, followed by the Princess of Macedonia and other
ladies in litters, the officers of the household, and a
long train of foreign Ambassadors, Princes, and
Knights of the Golden Fleece. Cardinal Farnese,
Don Ferrante Gonzaga, Viceroy of Sicily, the Prince
of Orange, the Dukes of Alva and Aerschot, Count
Egmont, B&uuml;ren, De Praet, Lalaing, and Granvelle,
were all present. In their rear came the troops&mdash;4,000
horse, 1,000 crossbowmen, 5,000 <i>Landsknechten</i>,
and a strong body of artillery, numbering in all
60,000 persons and 15,000 horses. Their entry lasted
six hours, and it was dusk before the last guns and
baggage defiled through the streets. Charles, with his
sister and niece, alighted at the Prinzenhof, the house
where he had been born just forty years before, and
the Archers' Guard took up their station at the gates.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
A strong body of infantry was encamped in the neighbouring
market-place, pickets of cavalry occupied
the chief squares, and the rest of the troops were
quartered in other parts of the city. But there was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>not the least show of resistance on the part of the
citizens. Absolute tranquillity reigned everywhere
while the stricken city awaited the Emperor's sentence.
It was, as might be expected, a severe one.
Twenty-three of the ringleaders were arrested, and
after a prolonged trial were found guilty. On the
17th of March, nine of these were put to death in the
market-place, while the others were banished and
heavily fined. On the 29th of April the Emperor
convened the chief officers of State and magistrates
in the great hall of the Prinzenhof, and, in the presence
of the Queen and her Court, delivered his sentence
on the guilty city. The charters and privileges of
Ghent were annulled, the property of the Corporation
was confiscated, and heavy additional fines were
imposed, beside the payment of the 400,000 florins
which had been the cause of the quarrel. In their
consternation, the burghers turned to Mary and implored
her to intercede on their behalf; but she
could only advise them to throw themselves on the
Emperor's mercy. On the 3rd of May a memorable
and historic scene took place in the court of the
Prinzenhof. Here the Emperor, seated on a tribunal,
with his crown on his head and sceptre in his hand,
and surrounded by the Archers' Guard, received the
senators and chief burghers, as, robed in black, with
bare heads and feet, and halters round their necks,
they knelt in the dust at his feet. The sentence of
condemnation was read aloud in the presence of a
brilliant assembly of nobles and courtiers, and of a
vast crowd who looked on from the windows and roofs
of the neighbouring houses. Then Mary, who occupied
a chair at her brother's side, rose, and, turning
to the Emperor, in eloquent words implored him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
have pity on his poor city of Ghent, and to remember
that he had been born there. The Emperor gave a
gracious answer, saying that out of brotherly love
for her and pity for his poor subjects he would pardon
the citizens and restore their property. But he decided
to build a citadel to keep the city in subjection, and,
after taking his brother Ferdinand to the top of the
belfry tower to choose a site, he eventually fixed on
the high ground above the River Scheldt, where
St. Bavon's Abbey stood. The demolition of the
ancient monastery was at once begun, and before the
Emperor left Ghent the first stone of the new fortress
was laid.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a></p>

<p>While these tragic events were taking place, a
succession of illustrious guests arrived at Court.
First of all, at the end of February, came Ferdinand,
King of the Romans, a simple and honest Prince,
the best of husbands and fathers, and as fondly
attached to his sister Mary as she was to him. At
the same time the Palatine Frederic sent his wife
to join the family party and plead her unfortunate
father's cause with the all-powerful Emperor. Although
his journey to England had failed to secure
Henry's support, he still cherished designs against
Denmark, and was anxious to prevent a renewal of
the truce between the Low Countries and King
Christian III. After consulting Archbishop Carondelet,
the President of the Council, and Granvelle, the two
sisters, Dorothea and Christina, drew up a petition to
the Emperor, imploring him to have pity on the poor
prisoner, who had already languished seven years in
solitary confinement, and reminding him gently of
the pledges given to the Palatine at his marriage.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1540</span>] WILLIAM OF CLEVES</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"My sister and I,"&mdash;so ran the words of Dorothea's
prayer&mdash;"your humble and loving children, entreat
you, as the fountain of all justice, to have compassion
on us. Open the prison doors, which you alone are
able to do, release my father, and give me advice as
to how I may best obtain the kingdom which belongs
to me by the laws of God and man."<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a></p></div>

<p>But although the sisters' touching appeal on behalf
of their captive father moved many hearts, and both
Henry VIII. and James V. of Scotland wrote to assure
the Palatine of their sympathy, no one was inclined
to embark on so desperate an enterprise, and Dorothea
went back to her lord at Heidelberg without having
obtained any satisfaction. On the 14th of April a
truce was concluded with the Danish Envoys, who
had followed the Emperor to Ghent, and the illusory
hopes of the three crowns which had been so long
dangled before the Palatine's eyes melted into thin
air.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a></p>

<p>There was still one important question awaiting
settlement. William of Cleves had sent three successive
Ambassadors to congratulate Charles on his return
and to seek the investiture of Guelders at his hand.
Now, at King Ferdinand's instance, he arrived at
Ghent one day in person, to the surprise of the whole
Court.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duke of Cleves," wrote an eyewitness of his
entry, "has come to Ghent with a fine suite, to claim
Guelders and marry the Duchess of Milan. This is
not to be wondered at, for she is a young and very
beautiful widow as well as a Princess of the noblest
birth. He who wins her for his bride will be a fortunate
man."<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>The English Ambassador at D&uuml;ren, Nicholas
Wotton, had done his utmost to prevent the Duke
from accepting Ferdinand's invitation; and Wyatt
was charged by Cromwell to neglect no means of
preventing an alliance which would defeat all his
schemes. The wily Ambassador laid his snares
cleverly. When the Cleves Ambassador, Olisleger,
told him that the Duke was about to wed the Duchess,
he whispered that his master had better be careful
and take counsel of King Henry before he took any
further pledges.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I told him," wrote Wyatt to King Henry, "to
advise his master, in case of marriage, to use his
friend's counsel, and herein, if I shall be plain with
Your Majesty, I cannot but rejoice in a manner of the
escape that you made there; for although I suppose
nothing but honour in the Lady, yet methinketh
Your Highness's mate should be without mote or
suspicion; and yet there is thought affection between
the Prince of Orange and her, and hath been of long;
which, for her bringing-up in Italy, may be noted but
service which she cannot let, but I have heard it to
proceed partly from her own occasion. Of this Your
Majesty will judge, and do with your friend as ye
shall think meet."<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a></p></div>

<p>Ren&eacute;'s courtship of the Duchess was no secret,
and Christina's preference for the popular Prince was
plain to everyone at the Imperial Court; but the unworthy
insinuations by which the Ambassador strove
to blacken her character were altogether his invention.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1540</span>] THE DUKE'S SUIT</div>

<p>Since this was the surest way to win both Henry's
and Cromwell's favour, Wyatt made unscrupulous
use of these slanders to poison William of Cleves's
mind against the Duchess whose hand he sought.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>On the 13th of April the Duke arrived at Ghent, and
was met by the Prince of Orange, who brought him
to King Ferdinand's rooms. Late the same evening
the English Ambassador had a secret interview with
him, and did his utmost to dissuade him from entering
into any treaty with the Emperor. The Duke's
irresolution was now greater than ever. The next
day Ferdinand himself conducted him into the
Emperor's presence, where he received the most
friendly greeting, and was invited to join the imperial
family at dinner. The gracious welcome which he
received from Mary, and the sight of Christina, went
far to remove his doubts, and during the next few
days the harmony that prevailed among the Princes
excited Wyatt's worst misgivings. The Venetian
Ambassador, Francesco Contarini, met the Countess
Palatine returning from Ghent, and heard from her
servants that a marriage was arranged between her
sister and the Duke of Cleves. Monsieur de V&eacute;ly, the
French Envoy, sent this report to Paris, and it was
confidently asserted at the French and English Courts
that Cleves had settled his quarrel with the Emperor,
and was to wed the Duchess.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1540</span>] AN ABRUPT DEPARTURE</div>

<p>But these reports were premature. The Duke
told Wotton and Wyatt that nothing would induce
him to give up Guelders, and at their suggestion he
placed a statement of his claims in the hands of
Ferdinand, who promised to submit the document
to the Emperor. During the next fortnight the
question was discussed in all its bearings by Charles
and his Councillors. The Duke pressed his suit for
the Duchess's hand, and the Emperor went so far as
to offer him the reversion of Denmark if he would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>renounce Guelders. But William was as obstinate as
the Emperor, and, when Ferdinand induced Charles
to offer Cleves his niece and the duchy of Guelders for
his lifetime, he quite refused to accept this proposal.
All Ferdinand could persuade him to do, was to
consent that the question of Guelders should be
referred to the Imperial Chamber, a compromise
which satisfied neither party. Still friendly relations
were maintained outwardly. On Sunday, the
27th of April, the imperial family attended Mass in
state, the Emperor riding to the Church of St. John
with the King of the Romans and the boy Legate,
Cardinal Farnese, on his left, followed by the Dukes
of Brunswick, Cleves, Savoy, and the Marquis of
Brandenburg. In the afternoon Ferdinand sent for
the Duke again, and made one more attempt to
arrange matters, without success. Some insolent
words spoken by Cleves's servants aroused the Emperor's
anger, upon which the Duke became alarmed,
and sent Wotton word that, seeing no hope of agreement,
he intended to return home. Early the next
morning, without taking leave of anyone, he rode
out of the town secretly, and never halted until he
was safe in his own dominions. His royal brother-in-law,
King Henry, sent him a long letter, congratulating
him on his safe return, and advising him
solemnly not to marry the Duchess of Milan without
finding out the true state of her affections towards
the Prince of Orange, lest he should be deceived.
Wotton told the King, in reply, that the Duke's affection
for Christina was now cooled, partly because she
had refused him, and partly because of the information
which Henry had given him. All idea of the marriage
was certainly abandoned, and on the 22nd of June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Cleves himself wrote to tell Henry that he had
received friendly overtures from the French King, and
was sending Ambassadors to make proposals for his
niece, the Princess of Navarre.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the Duke's strange conduct had excited
much surprise at Ghent. The Emperor, who had
spent the anniversary of his wife's death in retirement
at a Carthusian convent in the neighbourhood,
returned to find Cleves gone. Henry of Brunswick
rode with his friend to the outskirts of the town, and
hurried back to be present at the imperial table,
where he tried to explain the Duke's abrupt departure
by saying that he was afraid of treachery. But
Ferdinand and Mary were both seriously annoyed,
and the only member of the family to rejoice was
Christina, who felt that she could once more breathe
freely.</p>

<p>The pacification of Ghent was now complete, and
the bulk of the forces were disbanded. On Ascension
Day&mdash;the 6th of May&mdash;the imperial family attended
Mass at St. John's, the Queen "walking lovingly up
the church, hand in hand with the King of the
Romans." The Ambassadors were all present, as
well as Cardinal Farnese&mdash;in Wotton's opinion "a
very calf, and a greater boy in manners and condition
than in years."</p>

<p>On the 12th the King of the Romans took leave
of his family, but the Council at which he assisted
lasted so late in the evening that he did not actually
set out on his journey till two o'clock on the following
day. About six in the cool hours of the May morning,
the Emperor, with his sister and niece, rode out
to see the foundations of the new citadel laid, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
then continued their journey towards Antwerp,
where "great gun-shot" and bonfires welcomed their
arrival.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a></p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">July, 1540</span>] CROMWELL'S FALL</div>

<p>The Court spent the next three weeks at Bruges,
the beautiful old city which was always a favourite
with Charles and his sisters, in the ancient Prinzenhof
where their mother had died. During these summer
days many important events took place, and startling
news came from England. On the 10th of June
Cromwell was suddenly arrested and sent to the
Tower on a charge of high-treason. A fortnight later
the new Queen, Anne of Cleves, left Whitehall for
Richmond, and on the 9th of July her marriage was
pronounced null and void by a decree of Convocation.
The ostensible reason for the divorce was a precontract
between Anne and Francis of Lorraine. It
was true that as children they had been affianced by
their respective parents, but, as was common in such
cases, all idea of the marriage had been afterwards
abandoned, and Henry had professed himself entirely
satisfied with the explanations given by Anne's
relatives on the subject. But from the first moment
that he met his bride at Rochester, on New Year's
Day, 1540, he was profoundly disappointed. When
Cromwell asked him how he liked her, he replied,
"Nothing so well as she was spoken of," adding that,
had he known as much of her before as he did now,
she should never have set foot in his realm. However,
he felt constrained to marry her, for fear of
"making a ruffle in the world," and driving her brother
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>into the Emperor's arms. At Whitsuntide he told
Cromwell that from the day of his marriage he had
become weary of life, and took a solemn oath that
before God Anne had never been his lawful wife.</p>

<p>From that moment Cromwell knew that his own
fate was sealed. "The King loves not the Queen,"
he said to Wriothesley. "What a triumph for the
Emperor and the Pope!" A week afterwards he
was committed to the Tower, and on the 28th of July
he was beheaded.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<p>The news of his fall was received with general satisfaction
abroad. King Francis gave vent to boisterous
joy, and sent his brother word how sincerely he rejoiced
to hear that this false and wicked traitor, who had
brought the noblest heads in England to the block,
was at length unmasked. The Emperor, on the contrary,
showed no surprise or emotion when he heard
the news from Archdeacon Pate, the new Envoy
who had succeeded Wyatt, but merely said: "What!
is he in the Tower of London, and by the King's
counsel?" And when, on the 6th of July, Pate informed
him that the King had repudiated his wife,
he cast his eye steadfastly on the speaker, and asked
what scruples His Majesty entertained regarding his
marriage with the daughter of Cleves. The Ambassador
explained, as best he could, what he took to be
the motives of the King's action, upon which the
Emperor said that he was convinced Cromwell was
the true cause of all the terrible crimes which had of
late years been committed against religion and order
in England. So friendly was the Emperor that Pate
wrote to the Duke of Norfolk: "If His Majesty hath
thereby lost the hearts of the Electors, he hath in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
their places gained those of the Emperor and the
French King."<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1540</span>] REN&Eacute; OF ORANGE</div>

<p>Both at Bruges and Antwerp the news aroused
much excitement among the merchants, who were
unanimous in the opinion that the King now intended
to take the Duchess of Milan "for the true
heart which she bore him." But nothing was further
from Christina's mind. She had rejoiced at the
failure of the King's suit, and saw the Duke of
Cleves leave Ghent without regret. Now all seemed
ripe for the fulfilment of her long-cherished hopes.
The Prince of Orange had been unremitting in his
attendance on the Emperor since his arrival, and, as
all men knew, was honoured by His Majesty's confidence
and affection. His popularity with the army
was unbounded, and it was a common saying that
wherever the Prince's little pony went, every Dutchman
would follow. The Queen looked kindly on his
suit, and Christina's heart was already his own.
But when, in these bright June days at Bruges, he
modestly laid his suit before the Emperor, an unexpected
difficulty arose. Three years before a
marriage with the Duke of Lorraine's only daughter
had been proposed for the young Prince of Orange
by his uncle, William of Nassau-Dillenburg, the head
of the German branch of the house. The idea met
with Henry of Nassau's cordial approval, and at his
request the Emperor sent his servant Montbardon to
obtain Duke Antoine's consent. This was granted
without any difficulty, and the contract was drawn
up before the Count of Nassau's death.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> Now the
Duke urged the Prince to keep this long-standing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>engagement and marry his daughter Anne&mdash;the plain
but excellent lady whose portrait Holbein had taken
for King Henry. The Prince had never seen his
destined bride, and was very reluctant to carry out
the contract, but the Emperor was resolute. Antoine
already had a serious grievance in the matter of
Guelders, and it was of the highest importance to
secure his alliance. Accordingly, Charles told Ren&eacute;
that he must prove himself a loyal knight, and with
his own hand drew up the articles of the marriage
treaty, and sent them to Nancy by the Archdeacon
of Arras. Christina's name is never mentioned in
the whole transaction. It was the old story of the
Count Palatine and the Archduchess Eleanor. She
was a daughter of the House of Habsburg, and knew
that the Emperor's will must be obeyed. So she could
only bow her head in silence and submit to his decrees.
If she wept bitter tears, it was in secret, in her quiet
chamber in the ancient Cour des Princes at Bruges,
looking down on the green waters of the canal.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a></p>

<p>There was great rejoicing throughout Lorraine when
the Emperor's messenger reached Nancy and the
marriage was proclaimed. Anne was very popular
throughout the duchy, and since her mother's death,
a year before, had taken a prominent place at the
ducal Court, where her tact and kindness made her
universally beloved. The wedding took place in the
last week of August at Bar.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> All the members of the
ducal house were present, including the Duke and
Duchess of Guise, with their sons and daughters,
and the Cardinal of Lorraine, who came from the
French Court to pronounce the nuptial blessing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>The Prince of Orange's martial appearance and his
splendid suite made a favourable impression on his
new relatives, as Antoinette de Bourbon wrote to
her daughter in Scotland:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have delayed longer than I intended before
writing to you, but we have been so well amused by
the wedding of Mademoiselle de Lorraine that until
this moment I have not had leisure to begin this
letter. Yesterday we left the assembled company.
There was a very large gathering, and the wedding
took place last Tuesday. Monsieur le Prince arrived
honourably attended, and is, I can assure you, a
very charming and handsome Prince. He is much
pleased with his bride, and she is devoted to him.
They are to go home in a fortnight. The f&ecirc;te was at
Bar, but there were very few strangers present&mdash;only
a few nobles and ladies of the neighbourhood."<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p></div>

<p>On the 27th of September the Prince of Orange
brought his bride to Brussels, where the States were
assembled. The whole Court rode out to welcome
the happy pair, and escorted them to the Nassau
palace, where the Prince changed his travelling dress
for a Court mantle, and hastened to pay his respects
to the Emperor. A succession of f&ecirc;tes was given in
their honour, and dances, masques, and banquets,
were the order of the day. The Princess charmed
everyone by her gracious manners, and her fine figure
and splendid clothes and jewels became the object of
general admiration.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1540</span>] ANNE OF LORRAINE</div>

<p>On the 2nd of October a grand tournament was
given in the Prince's house, which the Emperor,
Queen Mary, and Christina, honoured with their
presence. Ren&eacute; himself challenged all comers at
the barriers, and his wife was the most charming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>hostess. Before Charles left, he presented Anne with
a costly ring, and appointed the Prince to succeed
Antoine de Lalaing as Stadtholder of Holland and
Friesland. Three days afterwards the newly-married
pair left Court for their own home at Breda, and
the Emperor set out on a progress through
Artois and Hainault, leaving his sister and niece at
Brussels.</p>

<p>Ren&eacute;'s wife soon became a great favourite with the
Queen, and Christina danced as gaily as the rest at the
wedding f&ecirc;tes. But it is significant that the only mention
made of her in contemporary records is in the
despatches of the English Ambassador, Richard Pate,
who tells us that the Duchess of Milan spent much of
her time in the company of her brother-in-law, the Palatine.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a>
Frederic had come to Brussels to confer with the
Emperor on German affairs, and, if possible, to raise a
loan of 600,000 ducats for his intended campaign
against Denmark. But although Charles professed
himself ready and anxious to oblige his good cousin,
the Regent would give him no answer, and ended by
telling him to get the money from the Imperial
Treasury. Richard Pate held long and confidential
conversations with the Palatine, who recalled his
visit to Windsor with delight, and spoke with warm
admiration of the beauty of the singing in St. George's
Chapel. He was curious to know if his old friend
the King had grown as fat as he was represented in
recent portraits, and rejoiced to hear that His
Majesty was lusty and merry. As for the Duchess
of Milan, he could only feel sorry that so charming a
lady should still lack a husband, and frankly regretted
that she had not married King Henry, or, failing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>him, the Prince of Orange.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> After his return to
Germany, Frederic made another attempt to bring
about his sister-in-law's marriage to the Duke of
Cleves, who still hesitated between his old love for
Christina and his reluctance to give up Guelders.
But negotiations were already in progress with another
suitor, who had bided his time patiently, and who
was now at length to obtain his reward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1539-41] LOUISE DE GUISE</div>

<p>The Prince of Orange's union with Anne of Lorraine
had strengthened the ties that bound her father
to the Emperor, and a second marriage, which took
place this autumn, united the two houses still more
closely. Among the young nobles who accompanied
Ren&eacute; to Bar for his wedding was Charles, Prince of
Chimay, the eldest son of the Duke of Aerschot, the
wealthy and powerful Governor of Brabant, who was
foremost among the Regent's confidential advisers,
and whom she affectionately called by the pet name
of "Moriceau." On the death of his mother in 1539,
the young Prince had succeeded to her vast estates,
and lived at the fine castle of Beaumont, near the
French frontier. At Bar he saw and fell in love with
Louise de Guise, the lovely girl whom Henry VIII.
would gladly have made his wife. But there were
difficulties in the young suitor's way. His own family
began by opposing the marriage, and it was some time
before Charles's consent could be obtained. The
Duke of Guise had long been the Emperor's most
bitter enemy, and was known to have strongly opposed
his journey through France. Fortunately,
Duchess Antoinette was from the first on the lovers'
side, and succeeded in gaining her husband's consent.
For some time past King Francis had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>trying to arrange a marriage between her eldest son,
the Count of Aumale, and the Pope's granddaughter,
"<i>Vyquetorya</i> Farnese," as Louise calls her in one of
her letters. But the Pope haggled over the dowry,
and insisted on asking the Emperor's consent; so
that Antoinette had a troublesome task in her lord's
absence, and complained sorely to the Queen of
Scotland of these vexatious delays.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"By way of consolation, however," she writes on
the 30th of November, "we have an offer for your
sister. Monsieur le Duc d'Aerschot has sent to ask
for her, on behalf of his eldest son, the Prince of
Chimay, a youth about twenty, handsome and well
brought up, we hear. He will give him a portion of
50,000 crowns a year, and he will have some fine
estates, such as the duchy of Aerschot, the principality
of Chimay, the counties of Beaumont and Porcien,
most of them near Guise. I have told your father,
who is at Court, and he approves, and has spoken to
the King and to our brothers, who all advise us to
accept the proposal. So do my brother-in-law [the
Duke of Lorraine] and my mother [Madame de
Vend&ocirc;me]. It has been arranged that we should all
meet at Bar on the Conception of Our Lady, as my
lord the Duke wishes the matter to be settled at his
house. I hope your father will be there, but if not
he will give me the necessary powers. If things can
be arranged, she will be well married, for the Prince
has great possessions and beautiful houses, and plate
and furniture in abundance. But it is a great
anxiety to be treating of two marriages at once."<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p></div>

<p>Happily for the good Duchess, the young Prince
had his way, and the contract between him and Louise
was duly signed at Bar on the 22nd of December.
On the same day the Emperor, accompanied by the
Regent and Duchess of Milan, paid a visit to the
Duke of Aerschot at Beaumont, and offered him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
their warmest congratulations on his son's marriage.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
The wedding took place at Joinville in the following
March, by which time Christina's own marriage to
Louise's cousin was arranged, and all Lorraine rang
with the sound of wedding-bells.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1541</span>] CHRISTINA'S BETROTHAL</div>

<p>The vaunted alliance between Charles and Francis
did not last long, and less than a year after the
Emperor and King had parted at St. Quentin,
vowing eternal friendship, a renewal of war seemed
already imminent. Francis was bitterly disappointed
to find that none of the great results which he
expected from Charles's visit had come to pass.
The Emperor firmly declined to marry his daughter,
and gave no signs of surrendering Milan to the Duke
of Orleans. All he would offer was the reversion of
the Low Countries as his daughter's portion if she
married Orleans. This failed to satisfy Francis, who
declared that he would have Milan and nothing else.
In order to prevent his niece, Jeanne of Navarre,
marrying the Prince of Spain, the King offered her to
the Duke of Cleves, who signed a treaty with France
this summer, but was not actually affianced to the
little Princess until the Duchess of Milan was finally
betrothed to Francis of Lorraine. Upon hearing of
the alliance between France and Cleves, Charles
retaliated by solemnly investing his son Philip with
the duchy of Milan. This ceremony took place at
Brussels on the 11th of October, and was regarded
by Francis as an open act of defiance. He vented his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>anger on the Constable, who asked leave to retire;
while Madame d'&Eacute;tampes did her best to obtain
her rival's disgrace and induce the King to declare
war against the Emperor. But Francis was loth to
let his old servant go, and said to Montmorency, with
tears in his eyes: "How can you ask me to let you
leave me? I have only one fault to find with you,
that you do not love what I love."<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> The Constable
consented to remain, and for the moment the crisis
was delayed.</p>

<p>After visiting the forts along the frontier and leaving
garrisons in every town, the Emperor came to Namur
for Christmas, and prepared for his final departure.
Forty chariots were needed for his own use, and all
the horses and carts in the neighbouring provinces
were requisitioned to provide for the conveyance of
his immense suite. On Innocents' Day the Court
moved to Luxembourg, and all the gentlemen of
the countryside rode out to meet the Emperor.
With him came the Queen and the Duchess of Milan,
and on the same evening they were joined by the
Duke of Lorraine and his son Francis, the Marquis
of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson. On the Feast of the Three
Kings the imperial party attended Mass in the
cathedral, and the Emperor, after his usual custom,
presented golden cups to three abbeys in the town.
And on the same day the marriage of the Marquis to the
Duchess of Milan was finally concluded, to the great
delight of the old Duke, who was as much pleased as
the bridegroom. Two days afterwards Charles took
an affectionate farewell of his sister and niece, and
went on to Regensburg, leaving them to return to
Brussels, while the Duke of Lorraine hastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Nancy to summon the States and inform his loyal
subjects of his son's marriage.<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a></p>

<p>On the 1st of March the contract drawn up by
the Imperial Ministers, Granvelle and De Praet,
was signed by the Duke of Lorraine at Bar, and on the
20th by the Emperor. The ducal manors of Blamont
and Den&#339;uvre were settled upon the Duchess, and, in
order that she might not lose any rank by her marriage,
the Marquis received the title of Duke of Bar.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
On the 12th of March the Queen and Duchess both
went to the Castle of Beaumont in Hainault, to be
present at the splendid reception which the Duke of
Aerschot gave his daughter-in-law. The Duchess of
Guise herself accompanied the beloved Louise to her
future home, and wrote the following account of the
festivities to Queen Mary of Scotland from her husband's
ch&acirc;teau at Guise:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1541</span>] WEDDING-BELLS</div>

<p>"I have been so confidently assured that the
safest way for letters is to send them by Antwerp
merchants that I am sending mine by this means,
and your sister will be my postmistress in future.
I wrote to tell you of the conclusion of her marriage,
and sent the articles of the treaty and the account of
her wedding by your messenger. I have just taken
her to her new home, a fine and noble house, as well
furnished as possible, called Beaumont. Her father-in-law,
the Duke, received her very honourably,
attended by as large and illustrious a company as you
could wish to see. Among others, the Queen of
Hungary was present, and the Duchess of Milan,
and both the Prince and Princess of Orange, who, by
the way, is said to be with child, although this is
not quite certain as yet, and I confess I have my
doubts on the subject. I think your sister is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>well married. She has received beautiful presents,
and her husband has made her a very rich wedding-gift.
He is young, but full of good-will and excellent
intentions. It did not seem at all like Lent, for the
sound of trumpets and the clash of arms never ceased,
and there was some fine jousting. At the end we
had to part&mdash;not without tears. I am now back at
Guise, but only for one night, and go on to-morrow
to La F&egrave;re. My brother the Cardinal, and my
brother and sister of St. Pol, will be there on Wednesday.
For love of them I will stay at La F&egrave;re over
Thursday, and set out again on Friday, to reach
Joinville as soon as may be, in the hope of finding
your father still there, as well as our children&mdash;that
is to say, the little ones and the priests."<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p></div>

<p>Ten days later Louise herself wrote a long and
happy letter to her sister from Beaumont, full of the
delights of her new home and of the kindness with
which she had been received by her husband's family.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Madame</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"Since God gave me this great blessing of a
good husband, I have never found time to write to
you. But I can assure you that I count myself
indeed fortunate to be in this house, for, besides all
the grandeur of the place, I have a lord and father-in-law
whom I may well call good. It would take
three sheets of paper if I were to tell you all the
kindness with which he treats me. You may therefore
be quite satisfied of your sister's happiness, and
she is further commanded to offer you the very humble
service of the masters and lords of this house, who
beg that you will employ them on any occasion that
may arise, since they will always be very glad to
obey your wishes. We also have a very wise and
virtuous Queen, who has done me the greatest honour
by coming here to our house, expressly, as she condescended
to say, to receive me. She told me herself
that she meant to take me for her very humble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>daughter and servant, and that in future she hoped
I should be often in her company, which, considering
how little she has seen of me, was exceedingly kind.
The Duchess of Milan said the same, and was the
best and kindest of all. We may soon hope to see
her in Lorraine, for her marriage to the Marquis is
in very good train. Since my mother went home,
she has sent a letter asking me to find out if this
route to Scotland will be shorter than the other.
If this is the case, and you like to send me your
letters for her, I shall be delighted. Only, Madame,
you must be sure to address your packets to the Duke
of Aerschot, which will be easy for you, as then the
merchants who come from Scotland will leave them
at Antwerp or Bruges, or any other town, and they
will not fail to reach me, since my father-in-law is
greatly loved and honoured throughout the Netherlands.
And I pray that God will give you a long and
happy life.</p></div>

</p>

<p>The keenest interest in these marriages was shown
at the Court of Scotland. King James wrote cordial
letters from Edinburgh to his sister-in-law and to
the Duke of Aerschot, and congratulated the Princess
of Orange on her happy expectations, begging her
to write to him and his wife more frequently.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> Anne
had always been on affectionate terms with her
aunt and cousins at Joinville, and the presence of
Louise at Brussels this summer was another bond
between them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1541</span>] AN UNWILLING BRIDE</div>

<p>Meanwhile King Francis was greatly annoyed to
hear of the Duchess of Milan's marriage. He complained
bitterly to the Duke of Guise and the Cardinal
of their brother's desertion, and vowed that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>Antoine and his son should feel the full weight of his
displeasure. He was as good as his word, and, when
the Prince assumed the title of Duke of Bar, disputed
his rights to this duchy on the ground that it was a fief
of the Crown. In order to satisfy these new claims,
the Duke was compelled to sign an agreement on the
22nd of April, by which he and his son consented to
do homage to the King for the duchy of Bar, and to
grant free passage of French troops through this
province.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>At the same time Francis invited the Duke of
Cleves to come to Blois, as he wished his marriage to
the Princess of Navarre to be celebrated without
delay. On the 11th of April the States assembled
at D&uuml;sseldorf were amazed to hear from Chancellor
Olisleger that their Duke, being unable to obtain the
Duchess of Milan's hand without the surrender of
Guelders, was about to contract another marriage
with the Princess of Navarre, and had actually
started on his wedding journey.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> The King and
Queen of Navarre had always been averse to their
daughter's union with the Duke of Cleves, but
Margaret's resistance was overcome by the royal
brother whom she adored, and her husband gave a
reluctant consent to the marriage; but the little
Princess Jeanne, a delicate child of twelve, refused
in the most determined manner to marry this foreign
Prince. In vain she was scolded and whipped, and
threatened by her uncle the King with worse punishments.
For many weeks the child persisted in her
refusal, and, when compelled to yield, signed a pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>test
on the eve of her marriage, which with the secret
connivance of her parents was duly witnessed and
preserved. On the 14th of June, 1540, the strange
wedding was finally solemnized at Ch&acirc;telh&eacute;rault, on
the Garonne. A series of Arcadian f&ecirc;tes in beautiful
summer weather were given by King Francis, who
never lost an opportunity for indulging his love of
romance. Arbours and colonnades of verdure were
reared on the river-banks. King Arthur and the
Knights of the Round Table were seen riding forth
in quest of adventure; high-born ladies, clad as
nymphs and dryads, danced on the greensward by
torchlight.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> The bridegroom gave his bride magnificent
jewels, although Jeanne was never seen in
public, and did not even appear at the ball on the
night before the wedding. Finally, when all were
assembled in the royal chapel, and the King came to
lead his niece to the altar, the little Princess, weighed
down by her costly jewels and gold and silver brocades,
was unable to walk. "Take her by the neck!"
cried the impatient monarch to Montmorency, and
the Constable of France, not venturing to disobey the
royal command, lifted up the frightened child in
his arms and bore her to the altar before the eyes of
the whole Court. As he did so he was heard to
mutter, "C'en est fini, de ma faveur, adieu lui dis!"
and, surely enough, the day after the wedding he
received his dismissal, and left Court, never to
return during the lifetime of Francis.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">July, 1541</span>] CHRISTINA'S WEDDING</div>

<p>The Duke had agreed, in order to satisfy the King
and Queen of Navarre, that the marriage should be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>merely formal, and consented to leave his unwilling
bride with her parents for another year. Accordingly,
three days later he bade them farewell,
and rode, attended by a strong French escort,
through the Ardennes, and travelled down the
Moselle and Rhine to Cologne. As he passed through
Luxembourg he saw the trained bands gathering in
force on the frontier, and heard that they were
assembling under Count B&uuml;ren to meet his successful
rival, Francis of Lorraine, and bring him to Brussels
for his wedding.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a></p>

<p>Here great preparations had been made to do
honour to the Emperor's niece, and the guests came
from far and wide. Christina's trousseau was worthy
of her exalted rank, and the Queen presented her
with a wonderful carcanet of rubies, diamonds, and
emeralds, with pendants of large pear-shaped pearls.
The marriage was solemnized on Sunday, the 10th of
July, in the great hall where, twenty-six years before,
Isabella of Austria, had been married to the King of
Denmark. Only two of the foreign Ambassadors
were absent from the wedding banquet&mdash;the Englishmen
Vaughan and Carne&mdash;a fact which naturally
excited much comment. King Henry changed colour
when Chapuys told him of Christina's marriage, and
was at no pains to conceal his surprise and vexation.
He said repeatedly that he wondered how the Emperor
could allow so noble and renowned a Princess
to marry the Marquis, when there could be no doubt
that Anne of Cleves was his lawful wife, and insisted
that this had been the chief reason of his own separation
from this lady. After the wedding he again
referred to the incident, and told Chapuys in confidence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
that the Duke of Lorraine had secretly made
over his rights on Guelders to the French King,
and would never help the Emperor against France,
since Monseiur de Guise and the Cardinal of Lorraine
were entirely on the French side. Chapuys listened
with polite attention, and reported most of the King's
conversation for the amusement of the Court at
Brussels.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a></p>

<p>Here a series of f&ecirc;tes took place after the wedding.
A grand tournament was held in front of the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville,
followed by the mock siege of a fortress in
the park, and a hunting-party in the Forest of Soignies.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a></p>

<p>On the 14th, the Duke and Duchess of Bar left
Brussels to pay a round of visits in the neighbourhood
and "see the country," and on the 27th the
Queen went to meet them at the Duke of Aerschot's
hunting-palace at Heverl&eacute;, near Louvain, and spent
several days there with the two other newly-married
couples, the Prince and Princess of Orange and the
Prince and Princess of Chimay.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1541</span>] A NOBLE LADY</div>

<p>Finally, on the 1st of August, the bride and bridegroom
set out on their journey, attended by a brilliant
company, which included the Prince and Princess of
Orange, the Duke of Aerschot, the Prince and Princess
of Chimay, the Counts of Berghen, B&uuml;ren, and
Brederode. They travelled by slow stages, resting
at Namur, Luxembourg, Thionville, and Metz. Triumphal
arches were erected over the gates of each
city, and the burghers came out in procession to
greet the bride. At Metz Christina was presented
with an illuminated book on "Marriage," by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>Regent of the University, &Eacute;dmond du Boullay, and
the Chapter of Toul offered her a gold cup, filled with
300 crowns, while the city gave her 200 crowns and
ten barrels of choice wine.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a></p>

<p>On the 8th the wedding-party reached Pont-&agrave;-Mousson,
and found a large family gathering waiting
to receive them. A few days before the Cardinal of
Lorraine had joined the Duke and Duchess of Guise
at Joinville, and had accompanied them to Pont-&agrave;-Mousson,
as Antoinette wrote,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"in order to give our new Lady her first greeting
and conduct her to Nancy. Great preparations have
been made to welcome her, and there is to be some
fine jousting. I will tell you if there is anything
worth writing, and must confess I am very curious
to see if the Marquis makes a good husband. At
least the country rejoices greatly at the coming of so
noble and excellent a lady."<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a></p></div>

<p>The Duchess of Guise had collected most of her
family for the occasion, and brought four of her sons&mdash;Aumale,
Mayenne, Charles, Archbishop of Reims,
and Louis, Bishop of Troyes&mdash;to Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, as
well as her little grandson, the Duke of Longueville,
the Queen of Scotland's son by her first marriage.
Duke Antoine and his younger son, Nicholas de
Vaudemont, Bishop of Metz, were also present,
together with all the chief nobles of Lorraine.</p>

<p>It was a strange meeting. Guise and his sons had
often crossed swords with the Prince of Orange and
Aerschot, and the Duke had refused to meet the
Emperor on his memorable visit to Chantilly. Now
he was engaged in repairing the forts along the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>frontier in view of another war, an occupation which
had at least one merit in his wife's eyes, and kept
him longer at home than he had been for many years.
All alike, however, friends and foes, joined in giving
the new Duchess a hearty welcome, and drank
joyously to the health and prosperity of the illustrious
pair.</p>

<p>At Pont-&agrave;-Mousson Francis took his bride to the
convent of Poor Clares, to see his grandmother,
Philippa of Guelders, who had taken the veil twenty
years before, but still retained all her faculties, and
was the object of her sons' devoted affection. The
Duke of Guise and his wife constantly visited the
good old lady, whose name appears so often in
Antoinette's letters, and who now embraced her new
granddaughter tenderly and gave the bridal pair her
blessing. The next day Christina entered Nancy,
where immense crowds assembled to receive her, and
choirs of white-robed maidens welcomed her coming
at the ancient gateway of La Craffe. One quaint
medieval practice which had lasted until this century
was dispensed with. It was the custom for a band
of peasants from the neighbouring village of Laxou,
to beat the pools in the marshes under the palace
walls all through the night when the Princes of
Lorraine brought their brides home, to drive away
the frogs, whose croaking might disturb the ducal
slumbers. But instead of this, the peasant women
of Laxou stood at the palace gates as the Duchess
alighted, and presented her with baskets of flowers and
ripe strawberries and cherries.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1541</span>] REJOICINGS AT NANCY</div>

<p>A grand tournament was held the following morning,
on the Place des Dames in front of the ducal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>palace, in which many of the Flemish nobles took
part, and was followed by a state banquet and ball&mdash;"all
very sumptuously done," wrote Lord William
Howard, the English Ambassador.<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> Then the wedding
festivities came to an end, the gay party broke
up, and the old city which was henceforth to be
Christina's home resumed its wonted air of sleepy
tranquillity.</p>

<h2>BOOK VIII<br />

CHRISTINA, DUCHESS OF LORRAINE<br />

1541-1545</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1477</span>] KING REN&Eacute;</div>

<p>The ducal house of Lorraine, into which Christina
had now married, was one of the oldest and proudest
in Europe. The duchy took its name of Lotharingia
from Lothair, a great-grandson of Charlemagne, who
reigned over a vast kingdom stretching from the
banks of the Scheldt and Rhine to the Mediterranean.
After this monarch's death, his territories became
the object of perpetual contention between the
German Empire and France, and were eventually
divided among a number of Counts and Barons who
owned the Emperor or the French King as their
suzerain. Godfrey of Bouillon, the leader of the first
Crusade, was one of many illustrious Princes who
reigned over Lorraine; but Gerard d'Alsace, who
died in 1046, was the ancestor of the ducal house to
which Christina's husband belonged.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> From him
descended a long line of hereditary Princes, who were
loyal vassals of France and took an active part in
the wars against England. Raoul, the founder of
the collegiate church and Chapter of St. Georges at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>Nancy, was killed fighting valiantly at Cr&eacute;cy, and his
son John was taken prisoner with the French King by
the Black Prince at Poitiers. Duke John's second son,
Ferry, Count of Vaudemont and Joinville, fell at Agincourt.
In 1444 this Prince's grandson, Ferry II., the
representative of the younger branch of the House
of Lorraine, married Yolande, daughter of Ren&eacute; of
Anjou, King of Provence, Jerusalem, and Sicily, and
Duke of Lorraine in right of his wife, Isabella, the
heiress of Duke Charles II. Yolande, whose sister,
Margaret of Anjou, married Henry VI., became
Duchess of Lorraine after the death of her nephew
in 1473, and united the two branches of the family
in her person. But she renounced the sovereignty in
favour of her son, Ren&eacute; II., who still bore the proud
title of King of Sicily and Jerusalem, although, as the
English Ambassador, Wotton, remarked, he had never
seen either the one or the other. Ren&eacute; had a fierce
struggle for the possession of Lorraine with Charles
of Burgundy, who defeated him completely in 1475,
and entered Nancy in triumph. But in January,
1477, King Ren&eacute; recovered his duchy with the help
of the Swiss, and Charles was defeated and slain in a
desperate battle under the walls of Nancy.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a></p>

<p>Ten years later Ren&eacute; married Philippa of Egmont,
sister of Charles, Duke of Guelders, and, together with
his admirable wife, devoted the rest of his life to the
welfare of his subjects and the improvement of the
capital. During his reign the ducal palace, founded
by his ancestors in the fourteenth century, was enlarged
and beautified, and the neighbouring church
and convent of the Cordeliers were built. Here
Ren&eacute; was buried after his early death in 1508, and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
sorrowing wife reared a noble monument in which he
is represented kneeling under a pinnacled canopy
crowned by a statue of the Virgin and Child.<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1519</span>] QUEEN PHILIPPA</div>

<p>Six stalwart sons grew up under Philippa's watchful
eye, to bear their father's name and maintain the
honour of his house. The eldest, Antoine, succeeded
Ren&eacute; as Duke of Lorraine and Bar, and the second,
Claude, became a naturalized French subject, and
inherited the family estates in France, including
Joinville, Guise, and Aumale. Both Princes were
educated at the French Court, where Claude became
the friend and companion of the future King Francis,
and in 1513 married Antoinette de Bourbon, the
Count of Vend&ocirc;me's daughter. This lovely maiden
was brought up with her cousins, Louis XII.'s
daughters, the elder of whom married Francis of
Angoul&ecirc;me, the heir to the Crown. When, in 1515,
this Prince succeeded his father-in-law on the throne,
he promised the young Duke of Lorraine the hand of
Louis XII.'s widow, Mary of England; but the fair
Dowager had already plighted her troth to Brandon,
Duke of Suffolk, and Antoine consoled himself with
another Princess of the blood royal, Ren&eacute;e de Bourbon,
daughter of Gilbert de Montpensier and Chiara Gonzaga.
The wedding was celebrated at Amboise on
the 26th of June, 1515, and Antoine and Claude both
left their brides in Lorraine with Queen Philippa
while they followed Francis to Italy. There they
fought gallantly by the King's side at Marignano.
Antoine was knighted on the field of battle, while
Claude received a dangerous wound, and a third
brother was slain in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Two of Philippa's
younger sons lost their lives in the French King's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>later campaigns. One was killed at Pavia, and Louis,
the handsomest of all his handsome race, died of the
plague in Lautrec's army before Naples. A sixth
son, Jean, Bishop of Metz, was made a Cardinal at
twenty, and, like his brother, Claude of Guise, became
a prominent figure at the French Court.</p>

<p>During Antoine's absence his duchy was governed
wisely and well by his mother, Philippa; but when he
no longer needed her help, the good Queen retired
from the world, and on the 8th of December, 1519,
entered the Order of the Poor Clares at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson.
Here she spent the remaining twenty-seven
years of her life in works of devotion, and
edified her family and subjects by the zeal with which
she performed the humblest duties, going barefoot
and wearing rough serge. But she still retained great
influence over her sons, who were all deeply attached
to her and often came to visit her in the convent.
By a will which she made when she forsook the world,
she left her furniture, jewels, and most of her property,
to her second son, Claude, "pour aider ce jeune
m&eacute;nage,"<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> and the Duke and Duchess of Guise went
to live at her dower-house of Joinville, the <i>beau
ch&acirc;tel</i> on the heights above the River Marne, which
had once belonged to St. Louis's follower, le Sieur
de Joinville. Here that remarkable woman, Duchess
Antoinette, the mother of the Guises, reared her large
family, the six sons who became famous as soldiers
or prelates, and the four beautiful daughters who
were courted by Kings and Princes. Antoine's wife,
Ren&eacute;e, had not the ability and force of character
which made her cousin a power at the French Court,
as well as in her own family, but she was greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>beloved in Lorraine, and inherited the cultivated
tastes of her Gonzaga mother&mdash;the sister of Elizabeth,
Duchess of Urbino, and sister-in-law of the famous
Isabella d'Este. Ren&eacute;e brought the graces and refinement
of the Mantuan Court to her husband's home,
and the blossoming of art which took place at Nancy
during Antoine's reign was largely due to her influence.</p>

</div>

<p><i>To face p. <a href="#Page_260">260</a></i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1541</span>] THE DUCAL PALACE</div>

<p>A whole school of local architects and painters were
employed to adorn the ducal palace, which under his
rule and that of his immediate successors became, in
the words of a contemporary, "as fine a dwelling-place
for a great Prince as could possibly be desired."<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a>
King Ren&eacute; had rebuilt the older portions of the house;
his son now added the noble gateway known as "La
Grande Porterie," with his own equestrian statue
carved by Mansuy Gauvain, and the magnificent
upper gallery called "La Galerie des Cerfs," from
the antlers and other trophies of the chase which hung
upon its walls.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> A wealth of delicate sculpture was
lavished on the fa&ccedil;ade. Flowers and foliage, heraldic
beasts and armorial bearings, adorned the portal;
"le b&#339;uf qui pr&ecirc;che"&mdash;an ox's head in a pulpit&mdash;appeared
in one corner, and on the topmost pinnacle,
above the busts of Ren&eacute; and Antoine, a monkey was
seen clad in a friar's habit. Within, the vaulted
halls were decorated with stately mantelpieces and
richly carved friezes. Without, the roofs glittered
with gilded copper fretwork and a tall bronze <i>fl&egrave;che</i>,
bearing the cross of Lorraine and the thistle of Nancy,
crowned the "Tour du Paradis," which enclosed the
fine spiral staircase leading to the Galerie des Cerfs.
Another round tower, containing an inclined way
broad enough for a horse and chariot, stood in the
older part of the palace, and led up to the Treasury,
where the Crown jewels were kept. Here, too, were
the apartments occupied by the ducal family. On
one side they opened on to the "Cour d'Honneur,"
where tournaments and pageants were held. On the
other the windows looked down on the gardens, with
their cut yews and box hedges, their arbours and
bosquets, and in the centre a superb fountain
adorned with <i>putti</i> by Mansuy Gauvain; while beyond
the eye ranged across the sleepy waters of the moat to
green meadows and distant woods.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> The grand portal
and state-rooms at the new end of the palace looked
down on the Grande Rue, and were only divided by a
narrow street from the shops and stalls of the market-place.
The fact that the Duke's house stood in the
heart of the city naturally fostered the affection with
which he was regarded by the people of Nancy. The
citizens were familiar with every detail of the ducal
family's private life, and took the deepest interest in
their comings and goings, their weddings and funerals,
in the guests who arrived at the palace gates, and in
the children who grew up within its walls.</p>

<p>Duke Antoine was especially beloved by his subjects.
Early in life he had learnt by experience the
horrors of war, and all through his reign he tried
manfully to preserve a strict neutrality between the
rival powers on either side, with the result that
Lorraine enjoyed an unbroken period of peace and
prosperity. The burden of taxation was lightened,
trade and agriculture flourished, and the arts were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
encouraged by this good Prince, who was justly called
the "father of his people." When his beloved wife
Ren&eacute;e died, in June, 1539, his sorrow was shared
by the whole nation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Since I sent my last letter," wrote the Duchess
of Guise to her daughter in Scotland, "you will have
heard of the death of your aunt&mdash;whom God pardon&mdash;a
fortnight ago. The attack&mdash;<i>a flux de ventre</i>&mdash;which
carried her off only lasted nine days, but she
was enfeebled by long illness. Nature could no
longer offer any resistance, and God in His good
pleasure took her to Himself. She died as a good
Christian, doing her duty by all and asking forgiveness
of everyone, and remained conscious to the end.
After Friday morning she would not see her children,
or even her husband, but, as this distressed him
greatly, she sent for him again after she had received
God. On Sunday she was anointed with holy oil,
and died at ten o'clock the next evening. It was
the tenth of June. It is a heavy loss for all our
family, but your uncle bears up bravely. He sent for
us, and I set out for Nancy at once, but only arrived
there after her death. Your father, with whom I
have been in Picardy, followed on Saturday. I have
just returned to Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, where I came to see
my mother-in-law, the good old Queen. The funeral
will be on St. John's Day, and your aunt will be
buried in the Cordeliers, opposite the tomb of the late
King" (Ren&eacute; II.).<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a></p></div>

<p>Four days after his wife's death, Antoine himself
sent these touching lines to his niece, the Queen of
Scotland:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1541</span>] FRANCIS OF LORRAINE</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I was glad to hear from you the other day,
Madame, and must tell you the great sorrow which it
has pleased God to send me, in calling my wife to
Himself. She died on the morrow of Pentecost. God
be praised, Madame, for the beautiful end which she
made, like the good Christian that she was. Com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>mend
me to the King your lord; and if there is any
service which I can render you or him, let me know,
and I will do it gladly.</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 15em;">"Your humble and loving uncle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 24.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Antoine</span>."<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>Ren&eacute;e bore the Duke a large family, but only
three of her children lived to grow up: Francis,
Marquis of Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, born in 1517; Anne, the
Princess of Orange, who was five years younger; and
Nicolas, Count of Vaudemont, born in 1524, who
took Deacon's Orders, and became Bishop of Metz
when the Cardinal of Lorraine resigned this see.
Francis had the French King for his godfather, and
was sent, as a matter of course, to be educated at
the Court of France with the Dauphin. This Prince
inherited the tall stature and regular features of his
father's family, together with his mother's love of
art and letters. His studious tastes and quick intelligence
made him the delight of all his teachers,
and King Francis was heard to say that the Marquis
du Pont was the wisest Prince of his age. But
although he could ride and tilt as well as any of his
peers, he was never robust, and the strain of melancholy
in his nature increased as years went by. In
1538 the young Marquis accompanied his father to
meet the Emperor at Aigues-Mortes, and made a very
favourable impression on Charles, who proposed that
he should marry one of King Ferdinand's daughters.
Several other alliances had been already suggested
for this promising Prince.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> In 1527, while he was
still a boy, the fateful marriage between him and Anne
of Cleves had been arranged; and when this was
abandoned, King Francis first offered him one of his
own daughters, and then his cousin, Mary of Vend&ocirc;me,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>whom the King of Scotland had deserted for the fair
Duchess of Longueville. At the same time
Henry VIII. asked Castillon to arrange a marriage
between his daughter Mary and the heir of Lorraine.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a>
But from the moment that Francis of Lorraine saw
the Duchess of Milan at Compi&egrave;gne his choice never
wavered, and his constancy triumphed in the end
over all difficulties.</p>

<p>The lamented death of Duchess Ren&eacute;e, and the
marriage of her only daughter, Anne, in the following
year, had left the palace at Nancy without a mistress,
and rendered Christina's presence there the more
welcome. The old Duke was as proud of his daughter-in-law
as his subjects were of their young Duchess,
and Christina's frank manners and open-handed
generosity soon made her very popular in Lorraine.
She received a cordial welcome from Antoinette and
the Guise Princes at Joinville, and was on the best
of terms with her young brother-in-law, Monsieur de
Metz. Above all, she was adored by her spouse, whose
devotion to Christina quickly dispelled the Duchess of
Guise's fears lest this grave and thoughtful Prince
should not prove a good husband. His love satisfied
every longing of her heart, and filled her soul with
deep content. After all the storms of her early
youth, after the lonely months at Milan and Pavia,
after the disappointment of her cherished hopes, the
young Duchess had found a happiness beyond her
highest dreams. As she wrote to her old friend
Granvelle a few months later: "My husband treats
me so kindly, and has such great affection for me,
that I am the happiest woman in the whole world."<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1541</span>] A VISIT TO FONTAINEBLEAU</div>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The King of France's ill-temper was the one drawback
to the general satisfaction with which Christina's
marriage had been received. The coldness with
which he treated the Duke of Lorraine and his son,
the sacrifice of their rights on Bar, rankled in the old
man's heart. His surprise was the greater when he
received a courteous invitation to bring his son and
daughter-in-law on a visit to the French Court. His
brother the Cardinal wrote saying that Queen
Eleanor was anxious to see her niece, and that the
King wished to confer the Order of St. Michel on her
lord, and begged Duke Antoine to accompany the
young couple to Fontainebleau.</p>

<p>Christina and her husband, who since his marriage
had become a strong Imperialist, were reluctant
to accept the invitation, lest an attempt should be
made to draw Lorraine into an alliance against the
Emperor. But the Cardinal's bland promises and
Antoine's anxiety to keep on good terms with the
King prevailed over their hesitation, and early in
November the two Dukes and the young Duchess
spent three days at Fontainebleau. Hunting-parties
and banquets occupied the first two days. Eleanor
took the greatest delight in her niece's company, and
the King, who could never resist a woman's charms,
was assiduous in his attention to Christina. The
Queen of Navarre's presence afforded the Duchess
additional pleasure, and this accomplished Princess
showed her Leonardo and Raphael's paintings, and
did the honours of the superb palace which had
excited the Emperor's admiration two years before.
On the third evening the King expressed his wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
to confer the Order of St. Michel on the young Duke
in so pressing a manner that it was impossible to refuse
this offer. But an unpleasant surprise was in store
for him and his father. The next morning the
Cardinal informed them that the King demanded
the cession of the town and fortress of Stenay, in
return for the privilege of holding the duchy of Bar.
This unexpected demand aroused an indignant
protest from Antoine and Francis. Stenay was one
of the bulwarks of Lorraine, and its position on the
frontiers of Luxembourg made it of great importance
to the defence of the empire. But nothing that the
Duke and his son could say was of the slightest avail.
They were told that if Stenay was not surrendered
peaceably the King would declare war and reduce
their country to subjection. These threats alarmed
the old Duke to such a pitch that before leaving
Fontainebleau he was induced to sign a treaty by
which Stenay was given up in perpetuity to the
French Crown. It was a grievous blow to the prestige
of Lorraine, and filled Christina and her husband
with grave fears for the future. The following letter
which the Duchess wrote to Granvelle a few weeks
afterwards shows how bitterly she resented the
wrong:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1541</span>] THE CESSION OF STENAY</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"You have no doubt heard of the voyage which
the Lord Duke my father-in-law, my husband, and I,
took to the French Court, where we made a very
short stay, but one which turned out very badly for
our house. For the King used violent threats to my
father and husband, and sent my uncle the Cardinal
to tell them that, if they did not satisfy his demands,
he would prove their worst enemy, and make them
the smallest people in the world. So they were compelled
to give him the town of Stenay, which is a
great loss to this house, and has vexed my husband
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>and me sorely, showing us how much we are despised
on that side, and to what risk of destruction we
should be exposed if it were not for the good help of
the Emperor, in whom I place my whole trust."<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p></div>

<p>Unfortunately for the Duchess and her husband,
Charles was at this moment engaged in his disastrous
expedition to Algiers. The news of the tempest
which wrecked his fleet on the coast of Africa had
reached the French Court, and it was confidently
asserted that the Emperor himself had perished, or
was a prisoner in Barbarossa's camp. These disquieting
rumours were set at rest early in December
by his safe return to Cartagena with the remnants of his
army. But his enemies had been active in his absence.
On the 15th of November the Duke of Lorraine set
his seal to the deed of cession, and a week later a
French garrison took possession of Stenay. General
indignation was excited throughout Europe by this
arbitrary act. Mary of Hungary entered a vigorous
protest in her brother's name against this surrender
of an imperial fief, and no sooner did the news reach
Charles than he told his Ambassador to require the
French King to do homage for the town. The new
English Ambassador, Paget, who arrived at Fontainebleau
a few days after the Lorraine Princes left
Court, noticed that the King "looked very black,
as if the Imperial Envoy had spoken of matters not
all the pleasantest"; while he informed his royal
master that the entertainment of the Duke of Lorraine
had been but cold, and that he had lost all
credit with the French.<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> When Chapuys told King
Henry at Christmas how King Francis had snatched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>Stenay from the Duke of Lorraine, the English
monarch only shrugged his shoulders, saying he had
always known no good would come out of that
marriage.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Christina and her husband found some
consolation for their wounded feelings in the friendly
reception which they met with at Joinville, on their
return from France. The Duke and Duchess of Guise
came to meet them at Annonville, and were eager to
do honour to their nephew's bride and show her the
beauties of their stately home. They had lately decorated
the halls and chapel with paintings and statues,
and Antoinette had laid out terraced gardens along the
wooded slopes on the River Marne, adorned with
pavilions and fountains. Nothing escaped the eye
of this excellent lady, who watched over the education
of her children and the welfare of her servants, and
managed her kitchen, stables, and kennels, with the
same indefatigable care. Her household was a model
of economy and prudence, and her works of mercy
extended far beyond the limits of Joinville. The
active correspondence which she kept up with her
eldest daughter, the Queen of Scotland, abounds in
details regarding every member of her family, and
above all her little grandson, the Duke of Longueville.
The Duchess's letters are naturally full of this precious
boy, who was the pet and plaything of the whole
household, and on whose perfections she is never
tired of dwelling. For his mother's benefit, she sends
minute records of his height and appearance, of the
progress which he is making at lessons, the walks
which he takes with his nurse.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>
<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1541</span>] AT JOINVILLE</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We have here now," she wrote to Mary of Guise,
on the 18th of November, "not only your uncle, but
the Duke and Duchess of Bar, on their way back
from Court. They are all making good cheer with us,
and your father is so busy entertaining them that
you will hardly have a letter from him this time.
Your eldest brother [Aumale] is here too, but goes
to join the King at Fontainebleau next week. I
shall go to my mother [the old Countess of Vend&ocirc;me],
who is quite well, and so also is the good old Queen,
your grandmother. I have kept as a <i>bonne bouche</i>
for you a word about our grandson, who will soon
be a man, and is the finest child that you ever saw.
I am trying to find a painter who can show you how
tall, healthy, and handsome, he is."</p></div>

<p>Sad news had lately come from Scotland, where the
Queen's two children, a boy of a year old and a new-born
babe, had died in the same week. Antoinette's
motherly heart yearned over her absent daughter in
this sudden bereavement.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Your father and I are sorely grieved at the loss
you have suffered," she wrote to Mary; "but you are
both young, and I can only hope that God, who took
away those dear little ones, will send you others....
If I were good enough for my prayers to be of any
avail with God, I would pray for this, but I can at
least have prayers offered up by others who are better
than I am, especially by the good Queen in her convent
and her holy nuns. We are glad to hear the
King bears his loss with resignation, and trust
God will give you patience to live for Him in this
world and in the next, to which tribulation is the
surest way."</p></div>

<p>And in a postscript she adds a word of practical
advice, saying that she did not like to hear of the poor
babes having so many different nurses, and fears
this may have been one cause of the mischief.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a></p>

<p>In return for this affectionate sympathy, King<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
James sent his mother-in-law a fine diamond and a
portrait of himself, which arrived during Christina's
visit, and excited much interest at Joinville. All the
Duchess of Guise's daughters were absent from home,
the youngest, Antoinette, having joined her sister,
Abbess Ren&eacute;e, in the convent at Reims, where she
afterwards took the veil. But her eldest son, as we
have seen, was at Joinville on this occasion. A tall,
dark-haired, olive-skinned youth, recklessly brave
and adventurous, Aumale was a great favourite both
in Court and camp, and his mother had been sadly
disappointed at the failure of the marriage negotiations,
which had cost her so much time and trouble.
The Pope's daughter, Vittoria Farnese, who was to
have been his wife, had since then been offered in
turn to the Prince of Piedmont and the Duke of
Vend&ocirc;me, and was eventually married to the Duke
of Urbino. Aumale himself cared little for the loss
of the Italian bride, whom he had never seen, and had
hitherto shown no eagerness for matrimony, but the
sight of Christina made a deep impression upon him,
and he never forgot his fair cousin's visit to Joinville.
The most friendly relations prevailed between the
two families, and frequent visits were interchanged
during the winter. Christmas was celebrated with
prolonged festivities at Nancy, and on the 6th of
February the old Duke wrote from Joinville to his
niece, the Queen of Scotland:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Your father and I have spent the last week
together, and have made great cheer with all our
family. Your son, De Longueville, is very well, and
has grown a fine boy.</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 9em;">"Your very humble and affectionate uncle,</span><br />

<p>In spite of these distractions, Christina found it
difficult to make her husband forget the loss of
Stenay. The injustice which had been done to the
House of Lorraine still rankled in his mind, and he
feared that the Emperor would hold him responsible
for the surrender of the town, and regard it as an act
of disloyalty. Christina accordingly addressed a long
letter to Granvelle, explaining that her husband had
been very reluctant to accept the French Order of
St. Michel, and had only done this at his father's
express command, before there had been any mention
of surrendering Stenay. Now she feared that the
King might make some fresh demand, which would
complete the destruction of the ducal house, and could
only beg the Emperor to help them with his advice
and support.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"For you may rest assured," she goes on, "that,
whatever His Majesty is pleased to command, my
husband and I will obey, although, as you know, my
father-in-law is somewhat difficult to please, and we
must do his will for the present. So I beg you
earnestly to point this out to His Majesty, and ask
him to give us his advice; for since our return to
Nancy my husband has been so sad and melancholy,
and so full of regret for the great wrong which his
house has suffered, that I am quite afraid it will
injure his health. Once more I beg you, Monsieur de
Granvelle, to be a good friend to us in the present,
as you have been in the past ... for we have received
so much kindness from you that I hope you will not
hesitate to give us whatever advice seems best in
your eyes. As for me, I am so much indebted to you
for having helped to place me where I am, that you
and yours will always find me ready to do you
service. For I can never forget that it is to you I
owe my present great happiness."<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1542</span>] KING HENRY'S WIVES</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>Charles, however, wrote kindly to his niece, and
refused to listen to the unkind tongues who tried to
poison his mind against her husband. By degrees
the young Duke recovered his equanimity, and
devoted his attention to beautifying the ducal palace
of Nancy. In the last years of Ren&eacute;e's life a Lorraine
artist, Hugues de la Faye, had been employed
to paint subjects from the life of Christ at one end
of the "Galerie des Cerfs," and hunting-scenes at the
other. Christina's presence gave new impulse to the
work, and the large quantity of gold-leaf and azure
supplied to the painters in the Duke's service, show
how actively the internal decoration of the palace
was carried on. In one particular instance Christina's
influence is clearly to be traced. By Duke
Antoine's orders, a fresco of the Last Supper was
begun by Hugues de la Faye in the refectory of the
Cordeliers, but was only completed after this painter's
death in 1542, by Crock and Chappin. These two
Lorraine artists were sent to Italy by Duke Francis
soon after his accession, and visited Milan amongst
other places. Here they saw Leonardo's famous
"Cenacolo" in the refectory of S. Maria le Grazie,
which was closely connected with the Sforza Princes,
and must have been very familiar to Christina
when she lived in Milan. The fresco which they
executed at Nancy is said to have been a replica of
Leonardo's great work, and kneeling figures of
Antoine and Ren&eacute;e were introduced on the same wall,
in imitation of the portraits of Lodovico Sforza and
Beatrice d'Este which are still to be seen in the
Dominican refectory at Milan. Unfortunately, the
Lorraine masters' painting suffered a still worse fate
than Leonardo's immortal work, and, after being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
partly spoilt by damp, was finally destroyed thirty
years ago and replaced by a modern copy.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a></p>

<p>During this winter, when Christina was happily
settled in her new home and surrounded by loyal
friends and subjects, news came from England of the
trial and execution of Henry VIII.'s fifth Queen,
Catherine Howard. When the Duke and Duchess
were at Fontainebleau, rumours reached the Court
that this unhappy lady, of whom Henry was deeply
enamoured but a short time before, had been suddenly
banished from his presence, and taken into
custody. "Par ma foi de gentil homme!" exclaimed
King Francis when he heard the account
of the Queen's misdeeds. "She has done wondrous
naughtily!"<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> But in England, as Chapuys reported,
much compassion was felt for the King's latest
victim, who had dragged down the noble house of
Howard in her fall. Lord William Howard, the
late Ambassador, was hastily recalled from France,
and sent to the Tower with his mother, the old
Duchess of Norfolk. The King himself, wrote
Chapuys, felt the case more than that of any of his
other wives, just as the woman who had lost ten
husbands grieved more for the tenth when he died
than for any of the other nine! But when the
luckless Queen was beheaded, Henry recovered his
spirits, and spent Carnival in feasting and entertaining
ladies with a gaiety which made people think
that he meant to marry again. "But few, if any,
ladies of the Court," remarked Chapuys, "now aspire
to the honour of becoming one of the King's wives."<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>

<p>It was an honour to which Christina herself had
never aspired. One day at the Court of Nancy,
conversation turned on the King of England, and
some indiscreet lady asked the Duchess why she had
rejected this monarch's suit. A smile broke over
Christina's face, and the old dimples rose to her cheeks
as she replied that, unfortunately, she only had one
head, but that if she had possessed two, one might
have been at His Majesty's disposal. It was a
characteristic speech, and has passed into history.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1542</span>] THE KING'S CHASE</div>

<p>All through the winter of 1541-42 preparations for
war were actively carried on in France, and intrigue
was rife among the Courts of Europe. Francis was
determined to profit by his rival's misfortunes, in
spite of the remonstrances of the Pope and of the
deputies who were sent by the Imperial Diet to adjure
him not to trouble the peace of Christendom while
the Emperor was fighting against the Turks. By the
end of the year he succeeded in forming a strong
coalition, which included Scotland, Denmark, Sweden,
and Cleves. The Palatine Frederic had once more
pressed his wife's claims to the three kingdoms, with
the result that Christian III. lent a willing ear to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>French King's advances, and sent Envoys to Fontainebleau,
where a secret treaty between France
and Denmark was signed a few days after the Duke
and Duchess of Lorraine had left Court. Francis
was now exceedingly anxious to draw Lorraine into
the league and induce Duke Antoine to take up arms
against the Emperor. In May he set out on a progress
through Burgundy and Champagne, taking the
Queen and all the Court with him, to inspect the
fortifications of the eastern frontier and enjoy some
hunting on the way. "Tell the Pope," he said merrily
to the Legate Ardinghelli, "that I do nothing but
make good cheer and amuse myself, whether I entertain
fair ladies or go a-hunting the deer." Paget and
the other Ambassadors complained bitterly of the bad
quarters "in peevish villages" which they had to put
up with as they followed the King from place to
place, wherever "great harts were to be heard of."<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a>
Fortunately, he found excellent sport at the Duke of
Guise's ch&acirc;teau of Esclaron, where he spent three
weeks, and declared that he had never been so happy
in his life.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The King," wrote Duchess Antoinette to Mary of
Scotland, "has found so many big stags here that he
says he was never in a place which pleased him
better, and that in spite of torrents of rain and
God knows what mud! And you cannot think how
fond he is of your father."<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a></p></div>

<p>She herself went to Esclaron to receive her royal
guest, taking the eight-year-old Duke of Longueville
with her, to make his bow to the King and be petted
by Queen Eleanor and her ladies. But the life of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>a Court lady, as she told her daughter, was little to
her taste, and she returned to Joinville early in June,
to keep the F&ecirc;te-Dieu and prepare her husband's
and sons' equipment for the war which was expected
to begin immediately. Two days later, on the 10th
of June, the Duke and Duchess of Bar paid the
French King a visit at Esclaron, and were present at
the reception of the Swedish Ambassadors, whom
Gustavus Wasa had sent to sign the new treaty.
The ceremony took place in a large barn hung with
tapestries and wreathed with green boughs. The
King and his guests sat on a raised da&iuml;s, draped with
cloth of gold, under a canopy, while the Princes of
the blood and the other courtiers, among whom were
no less than six Cardinals, stood below. Here Francis
listened patiently to a long Latin harangue from
the Swedish Ambassador, and then, coming down
from his seat, he mingled freely in the crowd of
Cardinals and Princes, gentlemen and yeomen, who
stood "all in a heap" at the doors of the barn, and
showed himself very affable, although, in Paget's
opinion, "his manner lacked the majesty which he
had noticed in his own master on similar occasions."<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1542</span>] THE FRENCH INVASION</div>

<p>Christina looked with curiosity at these Envoys
from the Northern kingdom over which her father
had once ruled, many of whom had known the
captive monarch in old days. This time she and
her husband had no cause to complain of the King's
treatment. He was all courtesy and smiles, and
assured them in the most cordial terms of the singular
affection which he bore to all their house. But he soon
saw that there was no prospect of inducing Antoine
and his son to join him against Christina's uncle, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>on the 12th of June he consented to sign an agreement
by which he promised to respect the neutrality
of Lorraine and the properties of the Duke's subjects.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
After spending another week at Joinville, enjoying
the splendid hospitality of the Guises, he left Eleanor
with the Duchess, and went on to Ligny, a strong
fortress on the borders of Luxembourg, where he gave
orders for the opening of the campaign.</p>

<p>By the middle of July four separate armies had
invaded the Emperor's dominions. Guise and
Orl&eacute;ans fell upon Luxembourg, Vend&ocirc;me entered
Flanders, the Dauphin attacked Roussillon, and the
forces of Cleves, under the redoubtable Guelders
captain, Martin van Rossem, laid Brabant waste
with fire and sword. But they met with determined
opposition in every quarter, and the heroism of the
Regent and her captains saved the Netherlands
from ruin.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The attack," wrote De Praet to Charles on
September 21, 1542, "was so secretly planned and so
well carried out that it is a miracle Your Majesty
did not lose your Pays-Bas. We must thank God
first of all, and next to Him the Queen, to whose
extreme care, toil, and diligence, this is owing."<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a></p></div>

<p>Fortunately for the Imperialists, Francis's extravagance
had emptied his treasury. All his money, as
Paget reported, was spent in building new palaces
and buying jewels for himself and his favourites.
Stenay and other places had been fortified at vast
expense, and by the end of the year most of the
French forces were disbanded for lack of funds.</p>

<p>It was a sad autumn at Joinville, where the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>Duchess wept and prayed for her absent lord and
sons, and sighed to think they were fighting against
her daughter Louise's husband and father-in-law. In
September Guise was invalided home, and he was
hardly fit to mount his horse again when the
parents received the news of Louise's death, which
took place at Brussels on the 18th of October. The
charming Princess had always been a delicate girl,
and now she died without leaving a child to comfort
the husband and father who had loved her so
well. This sad event was followed by tidings of the
disaster which had befallen the King of Scotland's
army in Solway Moss, and of his death on the
18th of December. Antoinette's heart bled for her
widowed daughter, who had just given birth to an
infant Princess at Linlithgow. "It came with a lass,
and it will go with a lass," were the words of the King
when he was told of the child's birth, a few days
before he died at Falkland Palace. Both Guise and
Aumale would gladly have hastened to Mary's help,
but it was impossible for them to leave the camp at
this critical moment, and Antoinette could only beg
her daughter to keep up her courage and trust in God,
"the Almighty, who would defend her and the poor
little Queen, who although so young is already exposed
to the insults of her enemies."<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1543</span>] BIRTH OF A SON</div>

<p>It was a no less anxious time for Christina in her
home at Nancy. From the palace roof the smoke
of burning villages was to be seen in all directions,
and the people of Lorraine were exposed to frequent
raids from the hordes of irregular soldiers in both
armies, and were compelled to raise trained bands
for the defence of the frontiers. It was only by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>strictest observance of the laws of neutrality that an
outbreak of actual hostilities could be avoided.
When Aumale was badly wounded by a shot from a
crossbow in the siege of Luxembourg, his uncle the
Duke sternly refused to have him carried into his
neighbouring castle of Longwy; and when Mary of
Hungary proposed to garrison this fortress to protect
his subjects from French aggression, he declined her
offer firmly at the risk of incurring the imperial displeasure.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
Christina herself spent Christmas at Fontainebleau
with her aunt, Queen Eleanor. This poor
lady was distracted with grief at the war between her
husband and brother, and spent much time in making
futile attempts to induce her sister, the Regent,
to listen to peace negotiations. Early in December,
while the King was hunting at Cognac, she sent a
gorgeous litter to Bar to bring the Duchess to Court,
and kept her there till the middle of January.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
A month afterwards&mdash;on the 13th of February&mdash;Christina
gave birth to her first child, a son, who
received the name of Charles, after her imperial uncle.
There was great rejoicing in Nancy, where the happy
event took place, and the old Duke himself went to
Pont-&agrave;-Mousson to bear the good news to the venerable
Queen Philippa, who thanked God that she had
lived to see her great-grandson. The little Prince's
christening was celebrated with as much festivity
as the troubled state of the country would allow,
and Christina's faithful friend, the Princess of Macedonia,
who had followed her to Lorraine, held the
child at the font and was appointed his governess.<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1543</span>] DUKE ANTOINE MEDIATES</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days before the Prince's birth a secret treaty
between the Emperor and King Henry was concluded
at Whitehall. Chapuys had at length attained the
object of his untiring efforts, and De Courri&egrave;res was
sent from Spain on a confidential mission to induce
Henry to declare war against France. The defeat
of the Duke of Aerschot at Sittard excited general
alarm in Flanders, and Mary was at her wits' end for
money and men. But the Emperor himself was
hastening across the Alps to the help of his loyal
provinces. The marriage of his son Philip with the
Infanta of Portugal had been finally settled, and with
the help of this Princess's large dowry and another
half-million of Mexican gold, Charles was able to raise
a large army of German and Italian troops. On the
22nd of August he appeared in person before D&uuml;ren,
the capital of Cleves, which surrendered within a
week. The Duke threw himself on the victor's
mercy, and was pardoned and invested anew with his
hereditary duchies, while Guelders was annexed to
the Netherlands and the Prince of Orange became
its first Governor. William of Cleves on his part
renounced the French alliance, and agreed to marry
one of King Ferdinand's daughters. His previous
marriage with Jeanne d'Albret was annulled by the
Pope, and this resolute young Princess had the satisfaction
of carrying her protest into effect. Encouraged
by these successes, Charles now laid siege to Landr&eacute;cy,
the capital of Hainault, which had been captured and
fortified by the French, and was joined by a gallant
company of English under Lord Surrey and Sir John
Wallop. "Par ma foi!" exclaimed the Emperor, as
he rode down their ranks, "this is a fine body of
gentlemen! If the French King comes, I will live<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
and die with the English."<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> But Francis refused to
be drawn into a battle, and the approach of winter
made both armies retire from the field.</p>

<p>The Duke of Lorraine took advantage of this temporary
lull to mediate between the two monarchs.
Old as he was, and suffering severely with gout,
Antoine came to the Prince of Chimay's house with
his son Francis, and begged for an audience with the
Emperor and Regent, who were spending a few days
at Valenciennes, on their way to Brussels. Charles
sent him word not to come into his presence if he
brought offers from the French King; but in spite
of these peremptory orders the two Dukes arrived
in the town on Sunday, the 17th of November, and
were received by the Emperor after dinner. Antoine
delivered a long oration begging His Imperial Majesty
to make peace for the sake of Christendom, and,
laying his hand on his breast, swore that he had
taken this step of his own free will, without communicating
with any other person. The old man's
earnestness touched Charles, who answered kindly,
saying that he was always welcome as a cousin and a
neighbour, and that this was doubly the case now
that his son had married the Emperor's dearly loved
niece. But he told him frankly that he had been
too often deluded by false promises to listen to French
proposals for peace, and that in any case he could do
nothing without the consent of his ally, the King of
England. Nothing daunted, the old Duke went on to
visit the Regent, and was found by Lord Surrey and
the English Ambassador Brian sitting at a table before
a fire in the Queen's room, playing at cards. Antoine
greeted Brian as an old friend, and asked him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
drink with him. But Mary sternly refused to listen
to the Duke's errand, being convinced that he came
from the King, and declaring that all the gentlemen
in his suite were good Frenchmen. When he and his
son were gone, she called Brian to her, and said:
"Monsieur l'Ambassadeur, heard you ever so lean a
message?" "Madame," replied the Englishman,
"if the broth be no fatter, it is not worth the supping,"
a sentiment which provoked a hearty laugh from the
Queen.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1544</span>] EGMONT'S WEDDING</div>

<p>Neither Queen Eleanor, who sent an entreating
letter with a present of falcons to her sister, nor
Cardinal Farnese, who brought fresh proposals of
peace from the Pope, fared any better. The young
Duchess Christina now determined to make an attempt
herself, and came to meet her uncle at Spires when
he attended the Diet. The ostensible reason of this
journey was to visit her sister Dorothea, but Charles,
divining her intention, sent the Countess Palatine
word that if the Duchess of Bar brought proposals
of peace she might as well stay at home. Christina,
however, arrived at Spires on the 8th of February,
with a train of fourteen ladies and fifteen horse, and
spent a week with the Count and Countess Palatine.
The sisters saw the Emperor and King Ferdinand every
day, and were to all appearance on the most affectionate
terms with them. But nothing transpired as to what
passed between Christina and her uncle in private.
On the day that she left Spires to return to Nancy,
Frederic heard of the death of his brother, the Elector
Palatine, and hastened to Heidelberg with Dorothea
to attend his funeral and take possession of the rich
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>Rhineland, to which he now succeeded. Six weeks
later he returned to do homage for the Palatinate,
and assist at the wedding of his cousin Sabina with
Lamoral d'Egmont, the hero of so many hard-fought
fields. The Emperor gave a sumptuous banquet in
honour of his gallant brother-at-arms, Dorothea led
the bride to church, and Frederic, in a fit of generosity,
settled 14,000 florins on his young kinswoman.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a></p>

<p>In this same month Ambassadors arrived at Spires
from Christian III. of Denmark, who had quarrelled
with the French King and was anxious to make peace
with the Emperor. In spite of a protest from the
Palatine, a treaty was concluded on the 23rd of May,
by which Charles recognized the reigning monarch's
title to the crown. So the long war, which had lasted
twenty-one years, was at length ended, and the
Emperor finally abandoned the cause of Christian II.
But a clause was added by which his daughters' rights
were reserved, and a promise given that the severity
of his captivity should be relaxed and that he should
be allowed to hunt and fish in the park at Sonderburg.
Christian III. gladly agreed to these more humane
conditions, and even offered to give Dorothea and
Christina a substantial dowry, but the Palatine
refused to accept any terms, and persisted in asserting
his wife's claims.<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a></p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1544</span>] CHARLES V. IN LORRAINE</div>

<p>Soon after her return from Spires, on the 20th of
April, 1544, Christina gave birth, at Nancy, to a
daughter, who was named Ren&eacute;e, after the late
Duchess. But her happiness was clouded by the illness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>of her husband, whose health had become a
cause of grave anxiety. Fighting was renewed with
fresh vigour in the spring, and unexpected success
attended the imperial arms. Luxembourg was recovered
by Ferrante Gonzaga, and the French invaders
were expelled from most of the strongholds
which they held in this province. The war raged
fiercely on the borders of Lorraine, and the annoyance
to which his subjects were exposed, induced Duke
Antoine to make another effort at mediation. Since
the Emperor turned a deaf ear to all appeals, he decided
to apply to King Francis in person, and on the
8th of May he set out in a litter for the French Court;
but when he reached Bar he was too ill to go any
farther, and took to his bed in this ancient castle of
his ancestors. His sons hastened to join him, and
Christina followed them as soon as she was able to
travel, and arrived in time to be present at her father-in-law's
death-bed. The fine old man made his will,
appointed his brothers, the Duke of Guise and the
Cardinal, to be his executors, and with his last breath
begged his son to rule Lorraine wisely and raise as
few extraordinary taxes as possible. Above all, he
adjured him to preserve his people from the scourge
of war, and use every endeavour to obtain the restoration
of peace. With these words on his lips, he
passed away on the 19th of June, 1544.<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> The new
Duke was as anxious for peace as his father, but the
moment was unpropitious for any efforts in this direction.
King Henry had at length taken the field and
invaded Picardy with a large army, and the Emperor
was bent on carrying the war into the heart of
France, and urged his ally to meet him under the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>walls of Paris. On the 17th of June Charles himself
came to Metz with Maurice of Saxony and the young
Marquis Albert of Brandenburg, the boldest warrior
in Germany, and prepared plans for the extension
of the campaign which Ferrante Gonzaga and the
Prince of Orange were carrying on in Champagne.
Here Francis of Lorraine joined him as soon as he
was able to mount a horse, and, after spending some
days at Metz, induced the Emperor to accompany
him to Nassau-le-Grand, where Christina was awaiting
him.<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> On his way Charles stopped at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson,
and paid a visit to Queen Philippa, the
sister of his old enemy Charles of Guelders, for whom
he had always entertained a genuine regard, and who
was proud to welcome the great Emperor under her
convent roof. Since the death of the Empress, five
years before, Charles had formed a fixed resolution
to end his days in some cloistered retreat, and he
looked with admiration, not unmixed with envy, on
the aged Queen's peaceful home, and the garden
where she hoed and raked the borders and planted
flowers with her own hands. It was a memorable
day in the convent annals, and one which left pleasant
recollections in the Emperor's breast.<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a></p>

<p>But although Charles was full of affection for
Christina and her husband, he declined to receive
the Cardinal of Lorraine, who begged for an interview,
and during his brief visit not a word was
spoken with regard to overtures of peace.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> On the
12th of July he took leave of the Duke and Duchess,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>and joined the Prince of Orange's camp before St.
Dizier. This town was strongly fortified, but Ren&eacute;
had taken up his position near a bridge across the
Marne, and opened fire from a battery of guns placed
in the dry bed of the castle moat. Charles himself
visited the trenches on the day of his arrival, and
early the next morning the Prince of Orange walked
round to inspect the artillery with Ferrante Gonzaga.
The Marquis of Marignano was sitting in a chair,
which had been brought there for the Emperor's use
the day before, and, seeing the Prince, sprang to his
feet and offered him his seat. Compliments were exchanged
on both sides, and the Prince finally sat
down in the empty chair. He had hardly taken his
seat before he was struck by a shell which, passing
between the Viceroy and the Marquis, broke one of
his ribs, and shattered his shoulder to pieces. They
bore his unconscious form to the Emperor's tent,
where he lay between life and death for the next
forty-eight hours. The whole camp was filled with
consternation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I doubt yet what will become of him," wrote
Wotton, who had followed Charles to the camp. "If
he should die of it, it were an inestimable loss to the
Emperor, so toward a gentleman he is, so well beloved,
and of such authority among men of war."</p></div>

<p>Before the writer had finished his letter, a servant
came in to tell him that the Prince was gone.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">July, 1544</span>] DEATH OF REN&Eacute;</div>

<p>A Spanish officer on the spot wrote a touching
account of the Prince's last moments. From the
first the doctors gave little hope, and when the Emperor
heard of Ren&eacute;'s critical state he hastened to
the wounded hero's bedside, and knelt down, holding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>his hand in his own. The Prince knew him, and
begged him as a last favour to confirm the will which
he had made a month before, and take his young
cousin and heir, William of Nassau, under his protection.
Charles promised to do all in his power for
the boy, and, with tears streaming down his face,
kissed the Prince's cheek before he passed away.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"His Majesty the Emperor," continued the same
writer, "saw him die, and after that retired to his
chamber, where he remained some time alone without
seeing anyone, and showed how much he loved him.
The grief of the whole army and of the Court are so
great that no words of mine can describe it."<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1544</span>] LA SQUELETTE DE BAR</div>

<p>From all sides the same bitter wail was heard.
There was sorrow in the ancient home at Bar, where
Ren&eacute;'s marriage had been celebrated with great rejoicing
four years before. The Duke and Duchess
wept for their gallant brother-in-law, and Christina
thought, with tender regret, of the hero who in
youthful days had seemed to her a very perfect
knight. The sad news was sent to De Courri&egrave;res at
the English camp before Boulogne, by his Lieutenant
of Archers, and the veteran shed tears over the
gallant Prince whom he had often followed to victory.
Great was the lamentation at Brussels when the truth
became known. Nothing but weeping was heard in
the streets, and Queen Mary retired to the Abbey of
Groenendal to mourn for the loss which the Netherlands
had sustained by Ren&eacute;'s untimely death.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> In
his own city of Breda the sorrow was deeper still.
There his faithful wife, Anne of Lorraine, was waiting
anxiously for news from the battle-field. Her father
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>had died a few weeks before, and now her lord was
torn from her in the flower of his age, and she was left
a childless widow. Early in the year she had given
birth to a daughter, who was christened on the 25th of
February, and called Mary, after her godmother, the
Queen of Hungary, but who died before she was a
month old. Now report said that she was about to
become a mother for the second time, but her hopes
were once more doomed to disappointment. By Ren&eacute;'s
last will, his titles and the greater part of his vast
estates passed to his cousin William of Nassau, a boy
of eleven, while a large jointure and the rich lands of
Diest were left to Anne for her life.<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The Prince's
corpse, clad in the robes of a knight of the Golden
Fleece, was borne to Breda, and buried with his
forefathers; but his heart was enshrined in the
Collegiate Church of Bar, among the tombs which
held the ashes of his wife's ancestors. On his death-bed
Ren&eacute; had expressed a wish that a representation
of his face and form, not as he was in life, but as they
would appear two years after death, should be carved
on his tomb. This strange wish was faithfully carried
out by Anne of Lorraine, who employed Ligier-Richier,
the gifted Lorraine sculptor, to carve a
skeleton with upraised hand clasping the golden
casket which contained the dead hero's heart. The
figure, carved in fine stone of ivory whiteness, was,
as it were, a literal rendering of the words, "Though
after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
flesh shall I see God." At the Revolution, the
Collegiate Church of Bar, with the chapel of the
Lorraine Princes, which Montaigne called the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>sumptuous in France, was entirely destroyed; but
Ren&eacute;'s monument was saved and placed in the Church
of St. &Eacute;tienne, where it is commonly known as "La
Squelette de Bar."<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a></p>

<p>The memory of this popular Prince lingered long
in the land of his birth, and his fame lived in the
songs of Flanders and Holland for many generations.
One of the best known begins with the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"C'est le Prince d'Orange,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trop matin s'est lev&eacute;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Il appela son page,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mon Maure, est-il brid&eacute;?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Que maudit soit la guerre&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mon Maure, est-il brid&eacute;?"<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And so the story goes on through many stanzas,
which tell how, in spite of his wife's dark forebodings,
the hero rode out to the wars to fight against the
French, how he met with his fatal wound, and never
came home again.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1544</span>] THE DUKE'S ILLNESS</div>

<p>The Prince's death threw a gloom over the imperial
camp, but did not diminish the warlike ardour
of his battalions, who swore with one voice that they
would avenge their leader. On the 17th of August
St. Dizier at length surrendered. "A right dear-bought
town," wrote Wotton, "considering the
number of men lost in the assault, and chiefly the
inestimable loss of that noble Prince." Ferrante
immediately sent a troop of light horse, with Francesco
d'Este at their head, against Joinville, the
splendid home of the Guises, although, as Wotton
remarked, this was rather a house of pleasure than a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>stronghold. The castle was spared by order of the
Emperor for the sake of his niece Christina, who
begged him not to add to the Princess of Orange's
grief by destroying her uncle's house; but the town
and churches were sacked and set on fire, and the
beautiful gardens, with their fine water-shows and
temples, were destroyed.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> The news was received
with consternation in Paris, where Antoinette and
her grandson had taken refuge, and the Duchess's
brother, Cardinal Bourbon, wrote to the Scottish
Queen telling her of the report that the enemy had
burnt down Joinville, which had fortunately proved
to be false. "The destruction of such a beautiful
house," he adds, "would indeed have been sad."<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a>
This calamity had been averted by Christina, but, in
their anger at the damage done by the imperial
troops, the Guise Princes hardly remembered the debt
that they owed her. The King was furious, and in
the first burst of his indignation sent the Duke of
Lorraine a message, threatening to destroy him and
all his house. The Duke now determined to go to
the French Court to defend himself from these charges
and see if it were possible to make proposals of peace
in this quarter. The Emperor's rapid advance had
excited great alarm in Paris. Even the King awoke
to a sense of danger, and said to Margaret of Navarre,
the sister to whom he turned in all his worst troubles,
"<i>Ma mignonne</i>, pray God to spare me the disgrace
of seeing the Emperor encamped before my city of
Paris." Queen Eleanor, in her distress, sent a
Dominican friar in whom she had great confidence&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>Don
Gabriel de Guzman&mdash;to implore her brother to
hear her prayers. But Charles was still obdurate.
He received Francis of Lorraine in the camp after
the Prince of Orange's death, but when he heard
that his nephew was going to the French Court, he
sent Montbardon to beg the Duchess, "as she loved
him," not to let her husband go to France so soon
after he had seen him, lest people should think that
he was sent by the Emperor to treat of peace.</p>

<p>Christina replied in a letter written, as Wotton remarked,
in her own hand, telling her uncle that she
had sent a servant post-haste to overtake her husband,
but that he was already at Ch&acirc;lons, and had gone
too far to retrace his steps. In spite of this manful
attempt, the Duke never reached Paris; he fell from
his horse in a fainting fit at &Eacute;pernay, and was brought
back in a litter to Bar, where Christina nursed him
for several weeks.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> His efforts, however, proved
more effectual than he had expected. The Emperor's
precautions were necessary owing to the jealousy
with which the English King regarded every proposal
of peace on the part of his ally, but in reality Charles
was almost as eager as Francis to put an end to the
war. His resources were exhausted, the plague was
raging in Luxembourg and Flanders, and he realized
the danger of advancing into the enemy's country
with the Dauphin's army in his rear, while his hopes
of the English march on Paris had been disappointed
by Henry's delays before Montreuil and Boulogne.
Under these circumstances he felt that he could no
longer refuse to treat with his foes. On the 29th of
August, a week after the Duke had started on his
unfortunate journey, Admiral l'Annebaut and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>French Chancellor were admitted into the Emperor's
presence, in the camp near Ch&acirc;lons, and conferences
were opened between them and Granvelle, with the
happy result that on the 19th of September peace
was signed at Cr&eacute;py-en-Laonnois.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1544</span>] DUKE ANTOINE'S FUNERAL</div>

<p>By this treaty the Duke of Orleans was to be given
either the Emperor's daughter in marriage, with the
reversion of the Netherlands as her dower, or else one
of his Austrian nieces with the immediate possession
of Milan. In return Francis was to renounce his
claims on Naples and Artois, restore the Duke of
Savoy's dominions, and endow his son with large
estates and revenues. All the towns and fortresses
which had been captured during the recent war
were to be restored, including Stenay, which, as
Charles pointed out, the King of France "had
seized in the strangest manner, and held by force
without paying homage, although it is notoriously
a fief of the empire."<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> As soon as peace was signed,
Granvelle's son, the young Bishop of Arras, was
sent to ask the English King to become a party
to the treaty; but Henry, who had just taken
Boulogne after a long siege, quite refused, and professed
great surprise to hear that the Emperor had
agreed to terms which seemed to him more befitting
the vanquished than the victor. On the other hand,
a strong party at the French Court complained that
the rights of the Crown were sacrificed to the personal
aggrandisement of Orleans, and on the 12th of
December the Dauphin signed a secret protest against
the treaty, which was witnessed by Vend&ocirc;me and
Aumale.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> But in the provinces where war had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>waging, peace was welcomed with thankfulness, and
the ruler and people of Lorraine could once more
breathe freely.</p>

<p>The Duke of Lorraine was now able to convey his
father's body from the Castle of Bar, where he had
died, to Nancy. On the 15th of September he and
his brother set out at the head of the funeral procession,
along roads lined with crowds of people
weeping for the good Duke who had ruled the land so
well. But since it was impossible for the Duke of Guise
and his family to come to Nancy at present, the last
rites were put off till the following year, and the old
Duke's remains were left to repose for the time in
the Church of St. Georges.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Little dreamt these loyal
subjects that before the year was over the young
Duke, on whom their hopes were fixed, would himself
be numbered with the dead, and lie buried in his
father's grave. But for the moment all was well.
The return of peace was hailed with rejoicing, and
the restitution of Stenay removed a blot from the
scutcheon of Lorraine, while the independence of the
duchy was confirmed by a decree of the Diet of Nuremberg,
to which the Emperor gave his sanction.<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess received a pressing invitation
to join in the festivities that were held at Brussels
to celebrate the peace. Charles and Mary arrived
there on the 1st of October, and were shortly followed
by Queen Eleanor, bringing in her train the Duke of
Orleans and the Duchess of &Eacute;tampes, who had used
all her influence with the King to bring about peace,
chiefly from jealousy of the Dauphin and his mistress,
Diane de Poitiers. The burghers of Brussels gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>the imperial family a magnificent entertainment at
the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, and presented Eleanor with a
golden fountain of exquisite shape and workmanship;
while the Emperor lavished costly presents on his
guests, and gave the Queen of Hungary the fine
domains of Binche and Turnhout in gratitude for her
services. Unfortunately, Christina was detained at
Nancy by a return of her husband's illness, and did
not reach Brussels till the 4th of November. By
this time Eleanor had set out on her return, and
Christina, eager to see her aunt, followed her to
Mons, and spent two days in her company. On the
7th the Duchess came back to Brussels with her
brother-in-law, Nicolas de Vaudemont, and remained
with her uncle and aunt during a fortnight. It was
her first visit to Brussels since her wedding, more
than three years before, and old friends and faces
welcomed her on all sides. But one familiar figure
was missing, and she found a melancholy pleasure in
the company of her sister-in-law, the widowed Princess
of Orange, whom she saw for the first time since
her gallant husband's death. Charles treated his
niece with marked kindness, and gave her a superb
necklace of pearls and diamonds as a parting present.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1545</span>] PEACE AND PROSPERITY</div>

<p>The winter was spent happily at Nancy, where the
new Duke and Duchess made themselves popular
with all classes. Francis gave free rein to his love
of art and letters, and encouraged scholars and artists
by his enlightened patronage. He took passionate
delight in music, and was never happier than when he
could surround himself with the best singers and
players on the lute and viol. Christina shared his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>artistic tastes, and was greatly interested in the improvements
of the ducal palace. Together they made
plans for the decoration of its halls and gardens,
and for the construction of new buildings and churches
in different parts of Lorraine, while the Court painters,
Crock and Chappin, were sent to Italy to collect
antiques and study the best examples of art and
architecture.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> At the same time Christina took deep
interest in the condition of her humbler subjects, and
tried to relieve distress by founding charitable institutions
on the pattern of those in Flanders. A new
period of peace and prosperity seemed to have
dawned on Lorraine, and everything promised a long
and happy reign.</p>

<p>By the end of the year the Duke and Duchess
of Guise returned to Joinville, and were actively
engaged throughout the winter in rebuilding the
ruined town and repairing the damage done by the
imperial soldiery. Old quarrels between the two
houses were forgotten, and friendly intercourse was
renewed. In February the Duke and Duchess of
Lorraine were present in the chapel of Joinville, at
the consecration of Guise's son Charles, as Archbishop
of Reims, and in March the Cardinal of Lorraine came
to Nancy to discharge the duties of executor to the
late Duke. Antoine had provided liberally for all his
children. Nicolas de Vaudemont, his younger son,
received a sum of 15,000 crowns, and Christina gave
her brother-in-law a handsome present of furniture,
to help him in setting up house. Some lordships near
Joinville were left to the Duke of Guise, and everything
was amicably arranged.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1545</span>] FRANCIS'S DEATH</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly the Duke fell ill for the third time, and
during several days his life was in danger. Wotton
was convinced that he had been poisoned by his
French enemies, and so alarming were the reports
which reached Brussels, that the Emperor wrote
privately to his new Ambassador in Paris, Granvelle's
brother-in-law, St. Mauris, begging him to keep a
watchful eye on the affairs of Lorraine, lest Guise
and the Cardinal should take advantage of their
nephew's condition to seize his domains. But this
time Francis recovered once more, and was able to
make his solemn entry into Nancy on the 16th of
April. At the Porte St. Nicolas he was met by the
three orders&mdash;the nobles, clergy, and people&mdash;and
walked on foot, with Nicolas de Vaudemont at his
side, followed by his Ministers, to the Church of St.
Georges. Here, kneeling at the high-altar, he kissed
the relic of the True Cross, and took a solemn oath
to respect the privileges of the people of Lorraine
and the liberties of the city of Nancy. After this a
<i>Te Deum</i> was chanted and a banquet held in the ducal
palace.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> The next week, by the advice of his doctors,
Antoine Champier and Nicolas le Pois, he went to
Blamont, in the hope that the invigorating air of the
hills might complete his cure; but he grew weaker
every day, and was subject to frequent fainting fits of
an alarming nature. In her anxiety, Christina sent
to Strasburg and Fribourg for well-known physicians,
and Mary of Hungary despatched her own doctor to
Nancy, and consulted eminent doctors in London
and Paris on the patient's symptoms.<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> But all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>was of no avail, and as a last resource the Duke was
carried in a litter to Remiremont, his favourite
shooting-lodge in the heart of the Vosges. It was
the end of May, and the beautiful woods along the
mountain slopes were in the first glory of their
spring foliage. For a moment it seemed as if his
delight in the beauty of the place and the life-giving
influence of sunshine and mountain air would restore
him to health. But already the hand of Death was
upon him. On the F&ecirc;te-Dieu he became much worse,
and his end was evidently near; but he was perfectly
conscious, and, sending for a notary, he made his last
will, appointing his wife Regent of the State and
guardian of her little son and daughter, and commending
her and his children to the Emperor's care. After
this he received the last Sacraments, and passed quietly
away on Friday, the 12th of June. He was not yet
twenty-eight, and had reigned exactly one year.<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a>
Death had once more severed the marriage tie, and
Christina, who but lately called herself the happiest
woman in the world, was left stricken and desolate,
a widow for the second time, at the age of twenty-three.</p>

<h2>BOOK IX<br />

CHRISTINA, REGENT OF LORRAINE<br />

1545-1552</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1545</span>] VAUDEMONT'S CLAIMS</div>

<p>The premature death of her husband left Christina
in a position of exceptional difficulty. Everything
combined to add to her distress. She herself was in
delicate health, expecting the birth of another child
in a few weeks, her only son was an infant of two
years and a half, and she had not a single near relative
or tried Minister to give her the help of his counsel
and experience. The Duke had appointed her Regent
of Lorraine during his son's minority, but even before
he breathed his last, her claims to this office were disputed.
Although Christina herself was popular with
all classes of her son's subjects, there was a strong
party in Lorraine which dreaded the influence of her
powerful uncle. At the head of this party was the
Rhinegrave, Jean de Salm, an able nobleman who
had always been French in his sympathies, and who
now seized the opportunity of the Duke's last illness
to advance the claims of Monsieur de Metz, seeing that
this young Prince would be an easy tool in his hands.
At ten o'clock on the F&ecirc;te-Dieu, when the Duke
had received the last Sacraments, the Count de Salm
entered his room with Nicolas de Vaudemont, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
thus addressed him: "Monseigneur, if it please God
to call you to himself, do you wish that Monsieur de
Metz, your brother, should have a share in the
administration of your State and the care of your
children, without prejudice to the arrangements
which you have already made, by word and in writing,
with your august wife the Duchess?" The dying
Prince, who was hardly conscious, murmured a faint
"Yes," upon which the Count summoned a notary
to write down the Duke's last wishes, and proceeded
to read the document to the Duchess in the presence
of her servants.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> Christina, in her bitter distress,
paid little heed to this interruption, and was only
anxious to return to her dying husband's bedside;
but immediately after his death she found herself
compelled to face the question. Owing to her
delicate state of health, she decided to put off the
Duke's funeral, as well as that of his father, until
the following year. A week after his death she joined
her young children at her dower-house of Den&#339;uvre,
and at the same time the Duke's body was removed
by Count de Salm, as Marshal of Lorraine, to the
collegiate church of this place, and buried in a temporary
grave, after lying in state during three days.</p>

<p>The Emperor was at Worms with the Elector
Palatine and his wife when the news of the Duke of
Lorraine's death reached him, and sent Montbardon
at once to his niece with letters of condolence.
Christina availed herself of this opportunity to ask
her uncle's advice regarding the deed drawn up by
Jean de Salm. Charles, realizing the critical nature
of the situation, immediately sent one of his most
trusted servants, Fran&ccedil;ois Bonvalot, Abbot of Luxeuil,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
to Nancy, with orders to assure the Duchess of his
protection, and if possible secure her the Regency
and sole charge of her children. Bonvalot was the
brother of Granvelle's wife, the excellent Madame
Nicole, and had only lately resigned the office of
Ambassador at Paris, and retired to Besan&ccedil;on to
administer the affairs of this diocese as coadjutor of
the Bishop. No one was better fitted to help the
widowed Duchess than this statesman, who was
intimately acquainted with the intrigues of the Guise
Princes and the French Court. He hastened to
Den&#339;uvre without delay, and, as soon as he had seen
Christina, wrote the following letter to his brother-in-law,
St. Mauris, giving a clear and graphic account
of the situation:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">My Brother</span>,<br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1545</span>] CHRISTINA'S DIFFICULTIES</div>

<p>"The Emperor, having been informed of Monsieur
de Lorraine's death, has sent me here to help his
niece the Duchess, and to secure her the administration
of the State and the guardianship of her children, which
belongs to her by right and reason, but which Monsieur
de Metz is trying to claim, by virtue of the custom of
this country, as well as of certain acts somewhat
suspiciously passed by the Count de Salm and other
of the nobles when the late Lord Duke was <i>in extremis</i>....
His Majesty, being anxious to comfort
the said lady in her great affliction, and act the part
not only of a good uncle, but of a true father, has sent
me here to give her advice and help, and begs you to
tell the Most Christian King the wrong which has
been done her in this strange fashion, and which His
Imperial Majesty will never allow, because of the close
relation in which this lady stands to him. He hopes
that the King will join with him in this, for the sake
of the friendship which he has ever borne to this
house and to this widowed lady and her orphan
children, whose fathers and protectors their two
Majesties ought to be. His Imperial Majesty begs the
King most earnestly not to allow the said lady to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>deprived of this Regency to which Monsieur de Metz
pretends, in spite of common right and the ancient
custom of Lorraine, as the Count of Salm's deed
abundantly shows, since this would have been superfluous
if the custom were such as he pretends it to
be. You will lay these same reasons before the
Cardinal and Monsieur de Guise. If you are told that
Queen Yolande resigned the government of Lorraine
in favour of her son, you will reply that this was done
of her own free choice; and if any person objects
that the mother of the late Duke Antoine and the
Cardinal and Sieur de Guise did not retain the administration
after her husband's death, you will point
out that the said Duke was of full age, and that the
said lady was content to lay down the government
on this account.... And, further, you will inquire
what the King intends to do in the matter, and if
he means to support Monsieur de Metz or take any
steps prejudicial to the said lady and the tranquillity of
these lands, and will inform His Imperial Majesty
and myself of these things without delay."<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p></div>

<p>When Bonvalot wrote this letter from Den&#339;uvre,
on the 27th of June, the young Archbishop of Reims
had already arrived there, with an agreement drawn
up by his uncle the Cardinal, which he submitted
to the Duchess for approval. He informed the Abbot
that King Francis trusted the said lady would avoid
all occasion of strife, which, as Bonvalot remarked,
was exactly what the Emperor wished, and Monsieur de
Metz, by his singular action, had done his best to prevent.
In this difficult situation Christina showed remarkable
good sense and tact. She told Bonvalot
frankly that she would gladly avail herself of her
brother-in-law's help in the administration of public
affairs, and wished to treat him with perfect friendliness
as long as she retained the sole charge of her children
and the chief authority in the State. Accordingly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
the agreement proposed by the Cardinal was adopted,
with some modifications, and signed at Den&#339;uvre, on
the 6th of August, by Christina, Nicolas, the Count
de Salm, and other chief officials of Lorraine. The
Duchess and her brother-in-law were appointed joint
Regents, and were to affix their seal to all public
deeds. Vaudemont was given a key of the Treasury,
and was allowed the patronage of one out of every
three vacant offices; but the real authority, as well
as the care of her children, was vested in the Duchess.
Bonvalot told the Emperor that, under the circumstances,
this was the best arrangement that could be
made, and Charles of Lorraine and his family had
nothing but praise for the Duchess's good-will and
moderation.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1545</span>] HER TACT AND WISDOM</div>

<p>A fortnight later, Christina gave birth to her second
daughter, who was named Dorothea, after the Countess
Palatine. But the severe mental strain which the
mother had undergone affected the child, who was a
cripple from her birth. On the 5th of November the
Treaty of Den&#339;uvre was ratified by the States assembled
at Neufch&acirc;teau, not, however, without considerable
discussion. Some of the nobles tried to limit the
Regents' powers, and managed to insert a provision
that none but Lorraine's should hold offices of State,
a measure clearly aimed at the Flemings and Burgundians
in the Duchess's service. Nicolas de
Vaudemont, being young and inexperienced, agreed
readily to these demands, which drew forth a strong
protest from the Emperor and Mary of Hungary. To
add to Bonvalot's dissatisfaction, Monsieur de Metz
accompanied the Archbishop on his return to France,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>without even informing Christina of his intention.
In spite of these provocations, she maintained the
same conciliatory attitude, and her prudence and
modesty excited the Abbot's sincere admiration.
The Emperor addressed an affectionate letter to his
niece, assuring her of his fatherly love and protection,
and saying that he would never cease to regard her
interests as his own. "And it will be a great pleasure
to me," he adds, "if you will often write to me, and
I on my part will let you hear from me in the same
manner."<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a></p>

<p>Christina now returned to spend Christmas at
Nancy, and settled in the ducal palace with her
children. Monsieur de Metz gave up his bishopric,
and renouncing the ecclesiastical profession adopted
the style of Count of Vaudemont. But he showed no
further disposition to make himself disagreeable to
his sister-in-law, and their mutual relations were
rendered easier by the presence of the Princess of
Orange, who spent most of the year at Nancy. The
two widowed Princesses were drawn together by
that tenderest of ties, the memory of those whom
they had loved and lost. Henceforth they became
the dearest and closest of friends. During all the
troubles and sorrows of the next twenty years Anne's
loyalty to her sister-in-law remained unshaken. Her
strong common-sense and practical qualities, her
coolness and courage in emergencies, were a great
support to Christina, while the confidence that Mary
of Hungary reposed in her proved no less valuable.
The harmony of the family circle continued unbroken,
and the internal administration of Lorraine was
carried on as peaceably as before. The conduct of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
foreign affairs presented far greater difficulties, and
all Christina's prudence was needed to steer the
way safely through the rocks that lay in her course.</p>

<p>In spite of his friendly professions, the French
King, it soon became evident, was likely to prove a
troublesome neighbour. As Wotton wrote when
Francis of Lorraine died, "If the sweet, vain hope
of the delivery of Milan did not let him, I think the
Duke's death might easily provoke the French King
to attempt somewhat on Bar and Lorraine."<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Even
before her husband's death, Christina had been involved
in a long correspondence regarding Stenay,
which the French refused to give up until Duke
Antoine's letters surrendering the town could be
produced. The missing papers were at length discovered
in possession of the French Governor, De
Longueval, who had maliciously concealed them, and
the town was evacuated at the end of August, 1545.
Ten days afterwards the Duke of Orleans died of the
plague at Abbeville, in his twenty-fifth year. The
loss of this favourite son was a heavy blow to Francis.
"God grant," he wrote to the Emperor, in an outburst
of deep emotion, "that you may never know what it
is to lose a son!" The event, as it happened, proved
most opportune for Charles, who was released from
the unpleasant necessity of giving his daughter or
niece to a worthless Prince, with Milan or the Netherlands
as her dower. But it naturally provoked
Francis to demand fresh concessions and revive his
old claim to Milan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1546</span>] THE CITADEL OF STENAY</div>

<p>The effect of this new quarrel was to increase
Christina's difficulties. When the French at length
abandoned Stenay, it was found that not only the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>recent fortifications had been destroyed, as agreed
upon in the Treaty of Cr&eacute;py, but that the old walls
of the town had been pulled down. Mary of Hungary
justly complained that the defenceless state of Stenay
was a grave cause of danger to Luxembourg, and
urged her brother to garrison the town, declaring, if
war broke out, the Duchess would be unable to maintain
the neutrality of Lorraine. Charles, who had
already left the Netherlands to attend the Diet of
Regensburg, now invited his niece to meet him at
Waldrevange, on the frontiers of Luxembourg, and
discuss the matter. Christina obeyed her uncle's
summons gladly, and assured him that she was quite
alive to the importance of Stenay, and had already
asked her subjects' help in rebuilding the town walls.
But since the presence of an imperial force might
excite suspicion, she proposed to place a young
Luxembourg Captain named Schauwenbourg in
command of the garrison. The plan met with Charles's
approval; but Mary was by no means satisfied, and
begged the Emperor to insist on an oath of allegiance
to himself being taken by the garrison and burghers.
Charles replied that no doubt the best plan would
be to keep Stenay altogether, but that this would be
a direct violation of the Treaty of Cr&eacute;py, as well as
a wrong to the little Duke, and might stir up the
French "to make a great broil."<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>The invaluable Bonvalot was now called in, and
accepted Christina's invitation to attend the funeral
of the two Dukes on the 14th of June. But when
the Abbot reached Nancy, he found that only Duke
Antoine's obsequies were about to be solemnized,
and that the Duchess had deferred those of her husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
in compliance with a request from the Guise
Princes. On the day after the old Duke's funeral,
Bonvalot had a long interview with Christina, who
expressed her anxiety to meet her aunt's wishes,
and explained that Vaudemont was only afraid of
arousing the suspicions of the French. While she
was speaking, Nicolas himself came in and told the
Abb&eacute; how grateful he felt to the Emperor for the
affection which he showed to his little nephew, and how
fully he realized the importance of defending Stenay,
but that he dared not risk exciting the displeasure
of Francis, who was already advancing a thousand
new claims on Bar. The members of the Ducal
Council, to whom the matter was referred, expressed
the same opinion, telling Bonvalot that they looked
to the Emperor as their father and protector, and
would guard Stenay as the apple of their eye. The
Abbot was satisfied with these assurances, and
advised the Emperor to leave the matter in his
niece's hands. Charles had empowered him to offer
Nicolas the restitution of the Abbey of Gorzes, which
he had formerly held, and which the Imperialists
had recovered from the French and rebuilt at considerable
expense. But Christina would not hear
of this, saying that her brother-in-law cared more
for the good of the State than for his private advantage,
and Nicolas himself told Bonvalot that he would
not endanger his nephew's realm for ten wealthy
abbeys.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">July, 1546</span>] THE GUISE FAMILY</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As for madame your niece, Sire," wrote the
Abbot, "I have always found her most anxious to
please Your Majesty, at whatever cost. But as a
mother she naturally fears to run any risks which
might injure her children, and would, if possible,
avoid these perils. She begged me, with tears in her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>eyes, to make Your Majesty understand this, and
have pity upon her, trusting that you will be content
with the promises of the Council, or else find another
and less dangerous way of defending Stenay. Sire,
I could not refuse to give you this message, in obedience
to Her Highness's express commands, and beg
you very humbly to take them in good part."<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a></p></div>

<p>So the incident closed, and for the time being
nothing more was heard of Stenay.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>The Duke of Guise and his family now stood higher
than ever in the King's favour. His eldest son,
Aumale, was dangerously wounded in the siege of
Boulogne by an English spear, which penetrated so
deeply into his forehead that the surgeon could only
extract the steel by planting his foot on the patient's
head. After this ordeal the Count lay between life
and death for several weeks, and owed his recovery
to the tender nursing of his mother, who preserved
as a trophy at Joinville the English spearhead which
so nearly ended her son's career.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> As soon as he
was able to move, the King sent for Antoinette, and
insisted on taking her to hunt at St. Germain, and
consulting her as to his latest improvements in this
palace. Her grandson, the young Duke of Longueville,
was also a great favourite at Court, and when
peace was at length concluded, the King gave him a
copy of the new treaty with England to send to the
Queen of Scotland. The boy enclosed it in a merry
letter, sending his love to the little Queen his sister,
and telling his mother that if she would not come to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>France he meant to come and see her, and was old
and strong enough to face the roughest sea-voyage.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a></p>

<p>The Cardinal now announced his intention of taking
the whole family back to Joinville, to attend the ducal
funeral; but once more the King interfered, and kept
them at Court for the christening of the Dauphin's
daughter, which was celebrated with great pomp at
Fontainebleau. Henry VIII. stood godfather, and
the little Princess was named Elizabeth, after the
King's mother, "as good and virtuous a woman as
ever lived," said the English Ambassador, Sir Thomas
Cheyney; while the Imperialists declared that the
name was chosen because of its popularity in Spain
and of the hopes of the French that the child might
one day wed Don Carlos.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile the arrival of the Guises was anxiously
awaited at Nancy. On the 17th of July Christina
wrote to inform Abbot Bonvalot that she had at
length been able to fix the date of her husband's
funeral:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Monsieur de Luxeuil</span>,<br />
</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1546</span>] FUNERAL OF DUKE FRANCIS</div>

<p>"I must inform you that I have heard from
the Cardinal and the Duke of Guise, who hope to be
here by the end of the month, so the service will be
held on the 6th of August, all being well. I beg you
will not fail to be present. As for my news, all I have
to tell you is that the King is giving me great trouble
in Bar, and is trying to raise a tax in the town, which
has never been done or thought of before. I fear
that in the end I, too, shall have to go to Court, but
shall wait until I hear from the Emperor. Can you
give me any information as to his movements? All
I can hear is that His Majesty is collecting a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>army to make war on the Princes of the Empire,
who have rebelled against him. I pray God to help
him, and send him success and prosperity, and have
good hope that my prayers will be heard, as this will
be for the good of Christendom. Here I will end,
Monsieur de Luxeuil, praying God to have you in His
holy keeping.</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">"La bien votre,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 22.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Chrestienne</span>."<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>The coming of the Guises, however, was again
delayed, and the funeral did not take place until the
17th of August. On the previous day the Duke's
corpse was brought from Den&#339;uvre to Nancy by the
great officers of State, and laid on a bier in the
Church of St. George's, surrounded by lighted torches
and a guard of armed men, who kept watch all night.
The funerals of the Dukes of Lorraine had always been
famous for their magnificence, and there was an old
proverb which said: "Fortunate is the man who has
seen the coronation of an Emperor, the sacring of
a King of France, and the funeral of a Duke of
Lorraine."<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> On this occasion nothing that could
heighten the imposing nature of the ceremony was
neglected. All the Princes of the blood, Nicolas
of Vaudemont, the Duke of Guise with his five sons
and grandson, rode out from the ducal palace to the
Church of St. Georges, and took their places, as chief
mourners, at the head of the long procession that
wound through the streets to the Cordeliers' shrine.
In their train came a multitude of clergy, nobles, and
Ambassadors from all the crowned heads in Europe,
followed by a motley crowd of burghers and humble
folk, all in deep mourning, with torches in their hands.
The chariot bearing the coffin was drawn by twelve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>horses, draped with black velvet adorned with the
cross of Lorraine in white satin. The Duke's war-horse,
in full armour, was led by two pages, while
the servants of his household walked bareheaded on
either side, with folded arms, in token that their
master needed their services no more. On the hearse
lay an image of the dead Prince, with the ducal
baton in his hand, clad in crimson robes and a mantle
of gold brocade fastened with a diamond clasp. This
effigy was placed on a huge catafalque erected in the
centre of the church, lighted with a hundred torches,
and hung with banners emblazoned with the arms
of Lorraine, Bar, Provence, Jerusalem, and the
Sicilies.</p>

<p>In the tribune above the choir knelt the Princess
of Orange, the Duchess of Guise, and her newly-wedded
daughter-in-law, Diane of Poitiers's daughter
Louise, Marchioness of Mayenne, all clad in the same
long black mantles lined with ermine. The Countess
Palatine, Dorothea, had arrived at Nancy on the
17th of June, to attend her brother-in-law's funeral,
but as the Guises failed to appear, she returned to
Heidelberg at the end of a fortnight.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1546</span>] ANNE DE LORRAINE</div>

<p>Christina herself was unable to be present, "owing
to her excessive sorrow," writes the chronicler, and
remained on her knees in prayer, with the Princess
of Macedonia and her young children, in her own
room, hung with black, while the requiem was
chanted and the last rites were performed.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> When
all was over, and the "two Princes of peace," as De
Boullay called Francis and his father, were laid side
by side in the vault of the Friars' Church, the vast
assembly dispersed and the mourners went their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>ways. Only Anne of Lorraine remained at Nancy
with her sister-in-law, who could not bear to part
from her. A letter which this Princess wrote to her
cousin, the Queen of Scotland, this summer is of
interest for the glimpse which it gives of the widowed
Duchess and the boy round whom all her hopes
centred:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Your Majesty's last letters reached me on the
day when I arrived here from home, and I regret
extremely that I have been unable to answer them
before. I am very glad to hear you are in good health
and kind enough to remember me. On my part, I
can assure you that there is no one in your family
who thinks of you with greater affection or is more
anxious to do you service than myself. I did not
fail to give your kind message, to Madame de Lorraine,
my sister, and Her Highness returns her most
humble thanks. You will be glad to hear that her
son is well and thriving. I pray God that he may
live to fulfil the promise of his early years. Everyone
who sees him speaks well of him, and his nature is
so good that I hope he will grow up to satisfy our
highest expectations. May God grant you long life!</p></div>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 16em;">"Your humble cousin,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 20em;">"<span class="smcap">Anne de Lorraine</span>."<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a></span><br />
</p>

<p>The Princess of Orange was still in Lorraine when
King Francis came to visit the Duchess. This
monarch was as active as ever, in spite of frequent
attacks of illness, and spent the autumn in making
a progress through Burgundy and Champagne, hunting
and travelling seven or eight leagues a day in the
most inclement weather.</p>

<p>In October he came to Joinville, and Christina, glad
to be relieved of the necessity of going to Court
herself, invited him to pay her a visit at Bar. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
this once stately Romanesque castle, of which little
now remains, the Duchess and the Princess of Orange,
"dowagers both," as Wotton remarks, entertained
Francis magnificently, and provided a series of hunting-parties
and banquets for his amusement.</p>

<p>The true object of the King's visit was to arrange a
marriage between the Duchess and the Count of
Aumale. The young soldier made no secret of his
love for his cousin's beautiful widow, Antoinette was
anxious to see her son settled, and both the King and
the Guises were fully alive to the political advantages
of the alliance. On the 26th of October Wotton
wrote from Bar, "The fame continues of a marriage
between the Dowager of Lorraine and the Count of
Aumale," although, as he had already remarked in
a previous letter, it was hard to believe the Duchess's
uncles would consent to the union. Aumale's own
hopes were high, and he sent a messenger to Scotland
to tell his sister of the good cheer which they were
enjoying in Madame de Lorraine's house at Bar.<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1546</span>] MARRIAGE PROPOSALS</div>

<p>But these hopes were doomed to disappointment.
Christina was determined never to marry again.
Like her aunt, Mary of Hungary, having once tasted
perfect happiness, she was unwilling to repeat the
experiment. Her beauty was in its prime, her
charms attracted lovers of every age and rank.
During the next ten or twelve years she was courted
by several of the most illustrious personages and
bravest captains of the age. She smiled on all her
suitors in turn, and gave them freely of her friendship,
but remained true to her resolve to live for her
children alone, and took for her device a solitary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>tower with doves fluttering round its barred windows,
and the motto <i>Accipio nullas sordida turris aves</i>
(A ruined tower, I give shelter to no birds), as
a symbol of perpetual widowhood.<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>Aumale consoled himself by winning fresh laurels
in the next war, and before long married another
bride of high degree; but Brant&ocirc;me, who was intimate
with the Guises, tells us that he never forgave
Madame de Lorraine for rejecting his suit, and remained
her bitter enemy to the end of his life.<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> The
King took Christina's refusal more lightly. He never
treated women's fancies seriously, and when he found
that Aumale's suit was not acceptable, he sought the
Duchess's help in a scheme that lay nearer his heart.
This was the marriage of his own daughter Margaret
with Philip of Spain, whose young wife had died,
in June, 1545, a few days after giving birth to the
Infant Don Carlos. The old scheme of marrying
this Princess to the Emperor's only son was now
revived at the French Court, and Christina, who had
always appreciated Madame Marguerite's excellent
qualities, entered readily into the King's wishes.
But, as she soon discovered, her aunt, Queen Eleanor,
was greatly opposed to the idea, and still ardently
wished to see Philip married to her own daughter,
the Infanta Maria of Portugal.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<p>From Bar Francis returned to spend All Hallows
at Joinville, where he enjoyed fresh revels, and
delighted the Duke of Longueville by telling him to
make haste and grow tall, that he might enter his
service.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Now he goes," wrote the boy's tutor, Jean de
la Brousse, "to keep Christmas at Compi&egrave;gne, and
will spend the winter in Paris, watching how matters
go with the Emperor and the Protestants, whose
armies have been three months face to face, and yet
do not know how to kill each other."<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p></div>

<p>In the same letter the writer describes how, on his
journey to Plessis, to bring the Princess of Navarre
to Court, he met the Queen of Scotland's sister,
Madame Ren&eacute;e, with a number of old monks and
nuns, on her way from Font&eacute;vrault to Joinville. On
the 16th of December Madame Ren&eacute;e took possession
of the Convent of St. Pierre at Reims, of which she
was Abbess, and the Duchess of Lorraine and the
Princess of Orange were among the guests present
at this ceremony, at the entry of her brother the
Archbishop into his episcopal city on the following
day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1547</span>] DEATH OF HENRY VIII.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the news of Christina's supposed marriage
travelled far and wide. It reached Venice, where the
fate of the Duchess who had once reigned over
Milan always excited interest, and was reported to
King Henry of England by one of his Italian agents.
His curiosity was aroused, and when the French
Ambassador, Odet de Selve, came to Windsor, he
asked him if his master had concluded the marriage
which he had in hand. "What marriage?" asked
De Selve innocently. "That of Madame de Lorraine,"
replied Henry testily. "With whom?" asked
the Ambassador. But Henry would say no more,
and relapsed into sullen silence.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> He had come back
from Boulogne seriously ill, and grew heavier and
more unwieldy every day. A week afterwards he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>had a severe attack of fever, and on his return to
London sent Norfolk and Surrey to the Tower.</p>

<p>Mary of Hungary was so much alarmed at this
fresh outbreak of violence that she sent to Chapuys,
who was living in retirement at Louvain, for advice.
The veteran diplomatist, who for sixteen years had
toiled to avoid a rupture between the two monarchs,
wrote back, on the 29th of January, 1547, advising
the Queen to take no action. "Physicians say," he
added, "that the best and quickest cure for certain
maladies is to leave the evil untouched and avoid
further irritation." When the old statesman wrote
these words, the King, whose varying moods he knew
so well, had already ceased from troubling. He died
at Whitehall on the 28th of January, 1547.</p>

<p>The news of his royal brother's death moved the
King of France deeply. "We were both of the same
age," he said, "and now he is gone it is time for me
to go hence, too."<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> In spite of the painful ailments
from which he suffered, Francis still moved restlessly
from place to place. Towards the end of Lent he
left Loches to spend Easter at St. Germain, but fell
ill on the way, and died at Rambouillet on the 31st
of March.</p>

<p>The death of these two monarchs, who filled so
large a place in the history of the times, produced a
profound sensation throughout Europe. No one felt
the shock more than the Duchess, who had been
courted by one Prince, and had lately received the
other under her roof. But a third death this spring
touched her still more closely. On the 28th of
February the good old Queen Philippa passed away
in her humble cell at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson. As she lay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
dying she asked what was the day of the week, and,
being told it was Saturday, remarked: "All the best
things of my life came to me on this day. I was born
and married to my dear husband on a Saturday, I
entered Nancy amid the rejoicings of my people, and
I forsook the world to take the veil, on this day, and
now on Saturday I am going to God." Her children
and grandchildren knelt at the bedside, but Guise,
her best-loved son, only arrived from Paris at the
last moment. She opened her eyes at the sound of
his voice. "Adieu, mon ami," she said, "and do
not forget to keep God before your eyes." These
were her last words, and as the pure spirit passed
out of this life the sound of weeping was broken by
the joyous songs of her pet lark.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>She was buried, as she desired, in the convent
cloister, and the people, who venerated her as a saint,
flocked to the funeral. Christina employed Ligier-Richier,
the sculptor of the Prince of Orange's monument,
to carve a recumbent effigy of the dead Queen
in coloured marbles on her tomb. The black cloak
and grey habit were faithfully reproduced, the finely-modelled
features were rendered in all their ivory
whiteness, and a tiny figure of a kneeling nun was
represented in the act of laying the crown at her
feet. When the convent church was pillaged by
rioters in 1793, this monument was buried by the
nuns in the garden. Here it was discovered in 1822,
and brought to Nancy, where it now stands in the
Church of the Cordeliers, near the stately tomb
which Philippa herself had reared to her husband,
King Ren&eacute;.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a></p>

<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Of the three great monarchs whose fame had filled
the world during the last forty years, only one remained
alive, and he was engaged in a desperate
struggle. Throughout the autumn and winter of
1546-47, Charles V. carried on a vigorous campaign
against the coalition of Princes known as the League
of Schmalkalde. Christina watched the progress of
the war with keen anxiety, and saw with distress
that her brother-in-law, the Palatine, had joined
the rebel ranks. Frederic had never forgiven the
Emperor for sacrificing his wife's rights by the
Treaty of Spires, and showed his displeasure by
refusing to attend the Chapter of the Golden
Fleece at Utrecht in January, 1546. He further
annoyed Charles by introducing Lutheran rites at
Heidelberg, and on Christmas Day he and Dorothea
received Communion in both kinds at the hands of a
Protestant pastor in the Church of the Holy Ghost.
But he still hesitated to take up arms against the
friend of his youth. At length, in August, he declared
himself on the Protestant side, and for the first time
the red flag of the Palatinate was seen in the camp
of the Emperor's foes. Before long, however, his
courage failed him, and when Charles recovered the
imperial city of Halle, in Suabia, Frederic hastened
thither to make his peace. Tears rose to the veteran's
eyes when the Emperor said how much it had grieved
him to see so old a friend in the ranks of his foes, but
hastened to add that he forgave him freely and would
only remember his past services. From this time
the Palatine's loyalty never again wavered, but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
was obliged to restore Catholic rites in Heidelberg
and to give up his fortress of Hoh-K&ouml;nigsberg in
Franconia to Albert of Brandenburg.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a></p>

<p>The Duke of W&uuml;rtemberg and the cities of Ulm
and Augsburg soon followed the Palatine's example,
and Charles's triumph was complete by the decisive
victory of M&uuml;hlberg. "God be thanked, who never
forsakes his own," wrote Granvelle to Mary of
Hungary from the battle-field, at midnight on the
24th of April.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> The Elector John Frederick of
Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse were made
prisoners, the League of Schmalkalde was dissolved,
and Titian commemorated the Emperor's
heroic deeds in a famous equestrian portrait.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1547</span>] THE DIET OF AUGSBURG</div>

<p>The peace of Lorraine was insured by the victory
of M&uuml;hlberg, and Christina shared in the general
sense of relief with which the close of the war was
hailed. When, in the following autumn, the Regent
and the Princess of Orange rode to meet the Emperor
at the Diet of Augsburg, the Duchess joined them
on the frontiers of Lorraine. These three august
ladies reached Augsburg on the 21st of November,
and were received by King Ferdinand, his son Archduke
Maximilian, and the Prince of Piedmont, who
met them outside the gates, and escorted them to
the Emperor's lodgings in the fine house of the
Fuggers. Here the Countess Palatine and Ferdinand's
daughter, the Duchess of Bavaria, were awaiting
them at the doors of the courtyard, and conducted
them into Charles's presence. During the next three
months Christina lived in the great banker's house,
with the other members of the imperial family, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>her uncle's guest. Augsburg itself was a noble city.
The wealth of her merchants, the splendour of their
houses and gardens, amazed every stranger who
entered her gates. "The Fuggers' house," wrote
Ascham, "would over-brag all Cheapside." The
copper roofs glittered in the sun, the carved and
painted decorations of the interior were of the most
costly and elaborate description.<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> And this winter
the streets of Augsburg were thronged with Princes
and ladies. It was the gayest and most splendid
Diet ever seen. Never before had so many Archduchesses
and Duchesses been present, never was
there so much dancing and jousting and feasting.
On St. Andrew's Day the whole imperial family
attended a solemn Mass in honour of the Knights of
the Fleece, and were entertained by the Emperor at
a banquet, after which the Queen of Hungary received
the Companions of the Order in her apartments.
On Christmas Day all the Princes and
Princesses were present at High Mass in the Cathedral,
and on the Feast of the Three Kings they attended
service in the Court chapel, when Granvelle's son, the
young Bishop of Arras, officiated, and the Palatine,
the Marquis of Brandenburg, and the Archduke,
presented the customary offerings of gold, frankincense,
and myrrh, in the Emperor's name. Except
on these state occasions, Charles dined alone and
never spoke at meals, but generally sat by the window
for an hour or two afterwards, talking to his brother
and sister or nephews and nieces.</p>

<p>King Ferdinand's rooms, on the contrary, were
never empty. He had lost his faithful wife, Anna of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
Bohemia, in January, but his son and daughter were
lavish in dispensing their father's hospitality. Like
his sister Mary, Ferdinand was very fond of music,
and enjoyed listening to his fine Kapelle, while one
of his favourite jesters was always present to amuse
the Electors and Princesses at his table.<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> His son,
the Archduke Max, as Ascham calls him, was a gay
and pleasant gentleman, "of goodly person and
stature," speaking eight languages, and very popular
with all classes, especially the Lutherans, whose
opinions he was supposed to affect. Charles's other
nephew, Emanuel Philibert, the Prince of Piedmont,
was another gallant squire of dames, as ready to take
part in masque and dance as he was foremost in
active warfare. Every evening there was music and
dancing in the King's rooms, and the old halls of the
merchants rang to the sound of laughter and melody.
In that joyous throng the Countess Palatine was the
gayest of the gay, and Christina forgot her sorrows
to become young once more.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1548] THE MARQUIS ALBERT</div>

<p>There was one man among the Princes assembled
at Augsburg who gazed with frank admiration at the
handsome Duchess; this was the Marquis Albert of
Brandenburg, Lord of Culmbach and Burgrave of
Nuremberg. While still a boy he succeeded to his
father's principality in Franconia, and was educated
by his uncle, the Duke of Prussia and Grand-Master
of the Teutonic Order. Although brought up a
Lutheran, he entered the Emperor's service before
he was twenty, and fought gallantly in the wars of
Cleves and Champagne. A wild and reckless spirit,
who rode hard, drank deep, and knew no fear, Albert
was adored by his soldiers, whose toils and hardships
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>he shared with cheerful courage, while his name was
the terror of all peaceful citizens. "Thunder and
lightning, devouring fire," wrote a contemporary,
"are not more terrible than the Marquis Albert on
the battle-field."<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> But there was a fascination about
this ruthless dare-devil which no woman could resist.
His sisters were passionately devoted to him,
and Bona, the Queen of Poland, tried in vain to marry
him to one of her daughters. Roger Ascham describes
him as</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"another Achilles, his face fair and beautiful, but
stern and manly, with flowing locks and great rolling
eyes, yet with a sad, restless look, as if he was ever
seeking what he could not find. A man of few words
withal, but with a deep, strong voice, ever more ready
to hear than to speak."<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></p></div>

<p>There seemed no heights to which this soldier of
fortune could not aspire. The Emperor treated him
with fatherly affection, and the Queen and the
Duchess of Lorraine honoured the sumptuous banquets,
in which he displayed his usual prodigality,
careless of the debts with which he was already
loaded.</p>

<p>Once more rumour was busy with Christina's name.
The Marquis Albert proclaimed himself her devoted
servant, and her marriage with the young King Sigismund
of Poland was seriously discussed at Augsburg.
This monarch's wife, the Archduchess Elizabeth, had
died before his accession, and his sister, the Electress
Hedwig of Brandenburg, was eager to bring about a
union between him and the Duchess of Lorraine;<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a>
but, as usual, these rumours ended in smoke, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>only marriage announced at Augsburg was that of
the Archduke Max and his cousin the Infanta Maria
of Spain, an alliance which had long been privately
arranged.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1548</span>] THE INTERIM</div>

<p>Early in the New Year another distinguished person
arrived at Augsburg, in the person of the great
Venetian master, Titian. He came in obedience to
an urgent summons from the Emperor, and during
the next few months painted a magnificent series of
portraits, including those of Charles and Ferdinand,
the captive Elector of Saxony, Chancellor Granvelle,
his wife, and his son, the Bishop of Arras, who
was a great admirer of Titian's art. Fourteen years
before, this same master had taken Christina's portrait,
when she came to Milan as the youthful bride of
Francesco Sforza; now he saw her again in the
flower of her womanhood, and, had opportunity
offered, would doubtless have painted her again. But
disquieting rumours of unrest on the frontiers of
Lorraine reached Augsburg, and on the 16th of
February the Duchess set out on her return to Nancy.
The Emperor gave his niece a costly ring as a parting
present, and Archduke Max, the Marquis Albert, the
Prince of Piedmont, together with the Countess Palatine
and the Princess of Orange, escorted her some
leagues on her way. When, a month later, the Queen
of Hungary left Augsburg, she paid Christina a visit at
Nancy, bringing with her Anne of Lorraine and William,
the young Prince of Orange, a promising boy of fifteen,
who was being educated at Court, and met with a
kindly welcome from the Duchess and her subjects for
the sake of the lamented Prince whose name he bore.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
By Mary's advice, the Regents took active measures
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>for the defence of the frontier and the fortification
of Nancy. An arsenal was founded, and two bastions,
which became known as those of Denmark and
Vaudemont, were built near the palace. Other improvements
were carried out at the same time: the
marshy ground under the walls was thoroughly
drained, and converted into a spacious square called
La Place de la Carri&egrave;re; many of the streets were paved
and widened; and the Count of Salm, Bassompierre,
and several of the nobles, built fine new houses along
the Grande Rue, opposite the Galerie des Cerfs.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Emperor remained at Augsburg throughout
the summer, endeavouring to effect a lasting settlement
of the religious question. On the 30th of June
the so-called "Interim" was proclaimed, a compromise
which satisfied no one, and was described by
Thomas Hoby, a young Englishman who came to
Augsburg this summer on his way to Italy, as an
attempt to set up the old Babylon again in Germany.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a>
A fortnight later the Diet was prorogued, and Charles
started for the Netherlands, where he arrived on the
8th of September, after more than two years' absence.</p>

<p>A few weeks before his arrival a marriage had taken
place, greatly to Mary's satisfaction, between the
widowed Princess of Orange and the Duke of Aerschot.<a name="FNanchor_408" id="FNanchor_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
This nobleman, the premier peer of the realm and
doyen of the Golden Fleece, had lost his second wife
in 1544, but was still in the prime of life, and, as his
daughter-in-law, Louise de Guise, told her sister, was
honoured and beloved throughout the Netherlands.
Christina could not herself be present at the wedding,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>but her brother-in-law Nicolas went to Brussels to
give his sister away. Here he fell in love with Count
Egmont's sister Margaret, and asked her hand in marriage.
This alliance met with the warm approval of the
Emperor and the Regent, but caused Christina many
searchings of heart. Already more than one attempt
had been made by the Guises to marry Vaudemont
to a French bride, and she feared that this union
would excite great displeasure in some quarters. In
her alarm she wrote to the Emperor, begging him to
forbid the marriage as dangerous to the welfare of
her State. Charles, however, declined to interfere,
and sent Granvelle's brother, Chantonnay, to
advise his niece politely to mind her own business.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Since the Count of Vaudemont is bent on marrying,"
he wrote to his Envoy, "it is far better that he
should come here for a wife than go to France; and
the Duchess need not feel in any way responsible for
the alliance, which is entirely his own doing....
And, indeed, I do not see how he could honourably
break his word, since we ourselves urged our cousins
of Egmont to agree to his proposals. But tell him
to come here as soon as he can, to prevent the French
from making any more mischief!"<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1548</span>] ADOLF OF HOLSTEIN</div>

<p>There was nothing more to be said, and the wedding
was celebrated in the Court chapel at Brussels, after
vespers, on the 23rd of January, 1549. The bride,
richly clad in cloth of gold and decked with priceless
gems, was led to the altar by the Queen, while
Charles brought in the bridegroom. A banquet and
masque were afterwards held in the palace, at the
close of which Mary once more took the bride by the
hand and conducted her into the nuptial chamber,
hung with crimson brocade and costly tapestries.
The next morning the newly-wedded Countess appeared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>at Mass, in another costume of green velvet
embroidered in silver, and jousts and dances succeeded
each other during the following three days,
ending with a magnificent banquet given by the
Duchess of Aerschot.<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<p>Among the company present on this occasion was
the Dowager Queen Eleanor, who came to Brussels
on the 5th of December, to make her home with her
beloved brother and sister. On his death-bed
Francis I. was seized with remorse for the way
in which he had neglected his wife, and begged his
daughter Margaret to atone for his shortcomings.
But although Margaret carried out her father's last
instructions faithfully, and asked his widow to remain
at Court, the new King showed his stepmother
scanty kindness, and Eleanor left France with few
regrets. Another guest at Margaret of Egmont's
wedding was Christina's cousin, Duke Adolf of Holstein,
the King of Denmark's youngest brother. Most
of his life had been spent in Germany, and he had
taken part in the campaign of M&uuml;hlberg with his
friend Albert of Brandenburg. Now, following the
wild Marquis's example, he came to Brussels in
October, 1548, and entered the Emperor's service.
This new recruit was cordially welcomed, and gave
a signal proof of his valour by carrying off the first
prize in the tournament held at the palace.</p>

<p>Christina herself maintained the prudent attitude
which she had adopted with regard to Vaudemont's
marriage, and refused to countenance by her presence
a union which excited much unfriendly criticism in
France. Two other weddings in which she was also
keenly interested took place about the same time.
On the 20th of October her old suitor, the brilliant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
and volatile Duke of Vend&ocirc;me, was married at
Moulins to Jeanne d'Albret, the heiress of Navarre.
This strong-minded Princess, who refused to wed
the Duke of Cleves, and took objection to Aumale
because his brother was the husband of Diane de
Poitiers's daughter, fell suddenly in love with
Vend&ocirc;me, and insisted on marrying him in spite of
her mother's opposition. So radiant was Jeanne on
her wedding-day that King Henry declared her to
be the most joyous bride whom he had ever seen.
Six weeks later Aumale himself was married at
St. Germain to Anna d'Este, daughter of Duke Ercole
II. of Ferrara and Ren&eacute;e of France. Ronsard
sang the praises of this Italian Venus who had taken
the Mars of France for her lord, and Vend&ocirc;me, gay
and inconsequent as ever, sent his old rival in war
and love a merry letter, bidding him follow his good
example, and stay at home to play the good husband.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a>
This union with the King's first cousin satisfied the
highest ambitions of the Guises, while Anna's charm
and goodness were a source of lasting content to
Duchess Antoinette. Christina was one of the first
to greet the bride on her arrival at Joinville. At
first the two Princesses, Brant&ocirc;me tells us, looked at
each other shyly, but with evident curiosity. The
tale of Aumale's courtship was well known, and
Christina naturally felt keen interest in the Este
Princess who came from Beatrice's home and was the
cousin of Francesco Sforza. "Anna," writes the
chronicler, "was tall and beautiful, but very gentle
and amiable. The two ladies met and conversed
together, and were soon the best of friends."<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1549</span>] CHRISTINA AT BRUSSELS</div>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>Christina's absence from her brother-in-law's
wedding had been a great disappointment to her aunts,
and she received a pressing invitation to come to
Brussels for the f&ecirc;tes in honour of the Prince of Spain,
whose arrival was expected early in the spring of
1549. Accordingly, on the 28th of March the
Duchess reached Brussels, attended by the Princess
of Macedonia, and was received by the Grand-&Eacute;cuyer
Boussu and a brilliant escort of gentlemen. One of
these was the Marquis Albert, whose name of late
had been frequently coupled with her own, the other
his friend Duke Adolf of Holstein. Christina naturally
hailed this meeting with her cousin, especially
now that his brother, King Christian, had alleviated
the rigour of her father's captivity. Since the
Palatine had abandoned all attempts to maintain his
wife's claims, the reigning monarch had agreed to
release his unfortunate kinsman from the dungeons
of Sonderburg. On the 17th of February the two
Kings met and dined together in a friendly manner,
after which the deposed monarch was removed to
Kallundborg, a pleasantly-situated castle on a promontory
of Zeeland, where he spent the remaining
ten years of his life in comparative freedom.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> This,
indeed, was all that the Emperor desired. In a
secret paper of instructions which he drew up for
Philip in case of his own death, he enjoined his son
to cultivate peaceable relations with the King of
Denmark, and do his utmost to keep the Princesses
Dorothea and Christina in his good graces, and insure
their father's good treatment, "without allowing him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>such a measure of liberty as might enable him to
assert his old claims and injure our State of Flanders
as he did before."<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the interest with which Christina
regarded the Danish Prince proved fatal to Adolf's
friendship with the Marquis. Before the outbreak
of the Schmalkalde War, Adolf had become affianced
to Albert's sister, Fr&auml;ulein Kunigunde. The wedding-day
was fixed, and the citizens of Nuremberg had
prepared gold rings and jewels for the bride, but the
disturbed state of Denmark compelled the Duke to
postpone his marriage for a time. Then, as ill-luck
would have it, he met the Duchess of Lorraine at
the New Year festivities at Augsburg, and fell desperately
in love with her. From this moment he forgot
Fr&auml;ulein Kunigunde, and took the first excuse he
could find to break off his engagement. Albert never
forgave the wrong, and, although the two Princes met
at Brussels and walked side by side in the Court
chapel on Candlemas Day, the old friendship between
them was turned to bitter enmity.<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1549</span>] PHILIP OF SPAIN</div>

<p>But now private grievances had to be put aside,
and friends and foes alike joined in the public rejoicings
which welcomed the Prince of Spain's arrival.
Charles was anxious to present his son to his future
subjects in the most favourable light, and no pains
were spared to produce a good impression both on
Philip himself and on the loyal people of Brabant.
On the 1st of April, Mary of Hungary, Christina,
and Anne of Aerschot, accompanied by the whole
Court, received the Prince at Ter Vueren, where they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>entertained him at dinner and witnessed a military
parade and sham-fight on the plains outside the town.
In the evening Philip made his state entry into
Brussels, clad in crimson velvet and riding on a
superb war-horse, attended by Albert of Brandenburg,
Adolf of Holstein, the Princes of Piedmont, Orange,
and Chimay, Alva, Egmont, Pescara, and many
other illustrious personages. The chief burghers and
city guilds met the Prince at Ter Vueren, and escorted
him to the palace gates, where the two Queens and
Christina conducted him into the Emperor's presence.
Philip fell on his knees, and his father embraced him
with tears in his eyes, and conversed with him for
over an hour. At nightfall the whole city was illuminated,
and bonfires blazed from all the neighbouring
heights. The next day a tournament was held
on the Grande Place, and a splendid gold cup was
presented to the Prince by the city, while the States
of Brabant voted him a gift of 100,000 florins and
hailed him with acclamation as the Emperor's successor.
But in the evening these rejoicings were interrupted
by the news of the Duke of Aerschot's
sudden death. He had gone to Spires to meet the
Prince, but had over-exerted himself, and died very
suddenly at his castle of Quievrain. It was a grievous
blow to Anne of Lorraine, who was once more left
a widow, before she had been married quite nine
months. The deepest sympathy was felt for her at
Court, and Mary lamented the loss of her wisest
Councillor. All festivities were put off till Easter.
Philip spent Holy Week in devotional exercises, and
rode to S. Gudule on Palm Sunday, at the head of a
solemn procession of knights bearing palms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1549</span>] HIS DEVOTION TO CHRISTINA</div>

<p>Charles took advantage of this quiet season to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
initiate his son into the administration of public
affairs and make him acquainted with the leading
nobles of the Netherlands. But the impression produced
by Philip was far from being a favourable one.
Short in stature and blond in complexion, with his
father's wide forehead and projecting jaw, he was
Flemish in appearance, but Spanish by nature. His
taciturn air and haughty and reserved manners
formed a striking contrast to the frank and genial
ways which endeared Charles V. to all classes of
his subjects. Thomas Hoby, who saw Philip at
Mantua, noticed what "small countenance" he
made to the crowd who greeted his entry, and heard
that he had already "acquired a name for insolency."
Wherever he went it was the same. "His severe
and morose appearance," wrote the Venetian Suriano,
"has made him disagreeable to the Italians, hated by
the Flemings, and odious to the Germans." His
marked preference for all that was Spanish gave
deadly offence to the Emperor's old servants, and
people in Brussels said openly that when Philip came
to the throne no one but Spaniards would be employed
at Court. In vain his father and aunt warned him
that this exclusive temper was ill-suited to a Prince
who was called to rule over subjects of many nations.
He spoke little in public and rarely smiled. During
the year which he spent at Brussels people said that
he was never seen to laugh except on one occasion,
when all the Court witnessed the famous national
f&ecirc;te of the Ommegang from the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, on
the F&ecirc;te-Dieu. Among the varied groups in the
procession was a bear playing on an organ, while
children dressed up as monkeys danced to the music,
and unhappy cats tied by the tail in cages filled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
air with discordant cries. At the sight of these
grotesque figures even Philip's gravity gave way, and
he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p>

<p>This cold and haughty Prince, who took no pains
to commend himself to his future subjects, showed
a marked preference from the first for his cousin
Christina. He sought her company on every possible
occasion, gave her rich presents, and devoted himself
to her service with an ardour which became a cause
of serious annoyance to his aunts.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Queen Eleanor," wrote the French Ambassador
Marillac, "is always trying to treat of her daughter's
marriage with the Prince, but with very little success,
and the great attentions which he pays the Duchess
of Lorraine, the evident delight which he takes in
her society, and the gifts which he bestows upon her,
have excited great jealousy."<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a></p></div>

<p>Before long Christina herself found Philip's attentions
embarrassing, and felt that it would be the
path of wisdom to leave Court. She was present,
however, at a second tournament given on the
Grande Place, on the 6th of May. That day Count
d'Aremberg (the husband of Christina's intimate
friend Margaret la Marck), Mansfeldt, Horn, and
Floris de Montmorency, held the lists against all
assailants, while Alva and Francesco d'Este were the
judges. Philip, who inherited little of his father's
taste for knightly exercises, but had been practising
riding and jousting diligently during the last few weeks,
entered the lists, and was awarded a fine ruby as a
prize, Egmont and the Prince of Piedmont being
the other victors. Albert of Brandenburg was present,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>but declined to take part in the tournament. He
had seldom been seen at Court since Philip's arrival
and spent most of his time in his own quarters,
compiling an account of his grievances against the
Emperor. One day Charles, fearing to lose his
services, sent Granvelle to offer him an honourable
and lucrative office in the Imperial Mint. Albert
replied loftily that, since he was born a Brandenburg,
no office which the Emperor had to bestow,
could exalt his station, and that as he never managed
to keep a sixpence in his own pocket, he would rather
not attempt to meddle with other people's money.
A few days after this he asked leave to retire to his
own domains. The last time that he appeared in
public was at the banquet which followed the tournament,
in the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville; here he sat at the Emperor's
table, opposite the Duchess of Lorraine, who was
placed between Philip and Emanuel Philibert of Piedmont,
while Adolf of Holstein sat next to the Princess
of Macedonia. All these illustrious guests joined in
the ball which closed the day's festivities, and dancing
was kept up with great spirit until after midnight.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1549</span>] THE GUISE PRINCES</div>

<p>Early the next morning Christina left Brussels,
accompanied by Vaudemont's wife, Margaret of
Egmont, and escorted for several miles on her journey
by the Prince of Spain. Three weeks later the
Marquis Albert also left Court, without taking leave
of the Emperor or the Queens. His abrupt departure
excited general surprise, and no one knew whether
it was due to his quarrel with the Duke of Holstein,
or to some imaginary affront from the Prince or the
Duchess of Lorraine; but when he was at some
distance from the town he sent back a warrant for a
pension of 4,000 crowns a year, which he had received
from the Emperor, as a sign that he was no longer
in his service.</p>

<p>During the course of the summer Philip made his
"joyeuse entr&eacute;e" into the different cities of the
Low Countries, and a memorable series of f&ecirc;tes was
given in his honour by Mary of Hungary at her
beautiful summer palace of Binche. At the end of
August the Duchess of Aerschot gave birth to a
posthumous son, who was christened by the Bishop
of Arras in the Court chapel, and named Charles
Philip, after his godfathers, the Emperor and the
Prince. But while Anne's second marriage and her
brother's union with Egmont's sister strengthened
the ties between Lorraine and Flanders, the close
connection of the younger branch of the ducal house
with France increased daily. After the marriage of
Guise's third son, Mayenne, with Diane de Poitiers's
daughter, his brothers were loaded with favours of
every description. Aumale was created a Duke
and appointed Governor of Savoy, and Charles was
made a Cardinal at the King's request, and loaded
with rich benefices. Their mother stood sponsor to
Henry II.'s daughter Claude, who was one day to be
the wife of Christina's only son, and had the deputies
of the thirteen Swiss cantons for her godfathers. A
new link was forged by the coming of the little Queen
of Scots to France in the autumn of 1548, as the
future bride of the Dauphin. Antoinette met her
granddaughter at Brest, and brought her to St. Germain,
where the charms of the little Queen soon won
all hearts. "I can assure you," wrote the proud
grandmother to her eldest son, "she is the best and
prettiest child of her age that was ever seen!" And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
her uncle the Cardinal added: "She already governs
both the King and Queen." At the Court ball in honour
of Aumale's wedding, all the guests stood still to
watch the lovely little Queen and the Dauphin
dancing hand in hand, and the King smiled maliciously
when the English Ambassador remarked that it was
the most charming thing in the world to see the two
children together.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>When Christina returned to Lorraine in May, 1549,
all the Guises were at Paris for the King and Queen's
state entry, and the young Duke of Longueville led
his grandmother's white horse in the procession.
After this Antoinette brought her daughter-in-law
to spend the autumn quietly at Joinville, and great
was the rejoicing when, on the last day of the year,
Anna gave birth to her first son, the Prince who was
to become famous as "Henri le Balafr&eacute;." Christina
was careful to remain on good terms with the family at
Joinville, and the presence of the Duchess of Aerschot,
who spent the winter in Lorraine, increased the friendly
intercourse between the two houses. Anne's letters
to her aunt and cousins abound in playful allusions to
early recollections, and she always addressed Aumale
as "Monsieur mon serviteur" and signed herself
"Votre bonne ma&icirc;tresse." When, in January, 1550,
the Duke of Guise fell ill, Christina sent her steward
Grammont repeatedly to make inquiries at Joinville.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1550</span>] DEATH OF GUISE</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We cannot rest satisfied," wrote the Duchess of
Aerschot from Nancy, "without hearing the latest
accounts of my uncle, and trust the bearer will bring
us good news, please God! My sister, Madame de
Lorraine, is so anxious about him that she feels she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>must send over again. I cannot tell you, my dear
aunt, how much she thinks of you, and how anxious
she is to do you any service in her power. As for
myself, if there is anything that I can do, you have
only to speak, and you will be obeyed."<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a></p></div>

<p>After a long illness, Claude of Guise breathed his
last on the 12th of April, and was followed to the
grave within a month by his brother, Cardinal Jean,
who died at Nogent-sur-Seine, on his return from
Rome. The Duke's funeral was solemnized in the
Church of St. Laurent at Joinville, with all the elaborate
ceremonial common on these occasions. Antoinette
made a great point of Christina's attendance,
and Anne promised to do her best to gratify her aunt's
wish in the matter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I shall be very glad," she wrote, "if it is possible
for Madame my sister to be present at the obsequies
of my uncle&mdash;to whom God grant peace!&mdash;and will do
my utmost to effect this, not only because of my own
anxiety to see you and my cousins, but because I
would gladly give you pleasure."<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p></div>

<p>Accordingly, the two Duchesses, accompanied by
the Count and Countess of Vaudemont and several
nobles, arrived at Joinville on Saturday, the 29th of
June, to condole with the widow and attend the
funeral rites that were protracted during the next
three days. Never was there a more attached family
than this of the Guises.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I cannot tell you the grief I feel," wrote the
Queen of Scotland to her bereaved mother. "You
know as well as I do that I have lost the best father
that ever child had, and am left both orphaned and
widowed."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span></p>

<p>An imposing monument, adorned with rich marbles
and bas-reliefs of the dead Prince's battles, was raised
by Antoinette to her husband's memory in the church
at Joinville. In the centre the Duke and Duchess
were both represented clad in robes of state, kneeling
with hands clasped together, and a long Latin epitaph
relating the hero's great deeds was inscribed below,
ending with the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Antoinette de Bourbon, his wife, and her six
sons, have erected this tomb, in token of undying
sorrow and love for an incomparable husband and
the best of fathers."<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a></p></div>


<h3>V.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1550</span>] CHARLES THE BOLD'S REMAINS</div>

<p>Charles V. had long cherished a wish to remove the
bones of his ancestor Charles the Bold from the
church of St. Georges at Nancy, where they had been
buried after his defeat, and bring them to rest in
his daughter Mary's tomb at Bruges. At first Christina
hesitated to give her consent, fearing to arouse
the resentment of her subjects, who were proud of
possessing this trophy of King Ren&eacute;'s victory, but
the urgent entreaties of her aunts at length induced
her to yield, and, after ascertaining that neither
Vaudemont nor the States of Lorraine had any objection
to offer, she consented to her uncle's request,
on condition that the removal of the remains should
be effected as quietly as possible. Late in the evening
of the 22nd of September, 1550, three imperial
deputies, the Bishop of Cambray, the Chief Justice
of Luxembourg, and the herald Toison d'Or, met
the Provost and Canons of St. Georges in the crypt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>of the collegiate church. A solemn requiem was
chanted, after which the tomb was opened and the
bones, wrapt in a white linen shroud, were reverently
laid in a wooden casket and committed to the charge
of two friars. A gift of 100 gold crowns was made
to the church in the Emperor's name, and the precious
casket was placed on a chariot drawn by four black
horses, escorted by a troop of twenty men-at-arms.
The little procession travelled the same night to Metz,
and thence across the frontier to Luxembourg. Bells
were tolled in all the towns and villages on their
way, and the <i>De Profundis</i> was chanted wherever a
halt was made, until on the 24th the casket was
safely deposited in the choir of the Cordeliers' church
at Luxembourg. Here Charles of Burgundy's bones
were placed in the grave of John of Luxembourg,
the blind King of Bohemia, who fell at Cr&eacute;cy, until,
nine years later, they were finally laid to rest by
his daughter's side in the shrine of Our Lady at
Bruges.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">[423]</a></p>

<p>When this pious act was safely accomplished,
Christina set out with Anne of Lorraine and the Count
and Countess of Vaudemont to join the imperial party
at Augsburg. Charles, Philip, and Ferdinand, had
been attending the Diet in this city since July, and
were joined there by Mary of Hungary, who, however,
was obliged to return to the Netherlands on the
26th of September, owing to troubles on the French
frontier. Christina's presence was the more welcome.
On the 30th of the same month Philip and his uncle
Ferdinand were riding in the fields near Augsburg,
when they noticed a cloud of dust on the highroad,
and, galloping off in this direction, met the Duchess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
of Lorraine and her companions, with a large train
of followers. Philip gallantly escorted his cousin to
the Emperor's lodgings, where she spent the next
three weeks. Her coming was the signal for a round
of festivities. While Charles and Ferdinand rode
together in earnest converse, or sat with closed doors
debating public matters, Philip and a few chosen
friends&mdash;the Prince of Piedmont, Duke Adolf, Pescara,
and Ruy Gomez&mdash;spent the days with the
Duchess and her ladies. Sometimes they went hunting
on the Bavarian plains, sometimes they danced
or played cards, and every evening they met at supper
in Christina's rooms.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1550</span>] ROGER ASCHAM</div>

<p>On the 16th of October a joust was held in the
court of the Fuggers' house, and the Emperor, with
his niece and Duchess Anne, looked on from the
windows. Egmont and Vaudemont were judges, and
Count Lalaing and Floris de Montmorency won the
prizes. The Cardinal of Trent entertained the company
at supper, and left the next day for Genoa to
receive Maximilian, the King of Bohemia, who had
been sent for from Spain to take part in the family
conference. Three days later Philip gave a tournament
on a grander scale, in honour of the Duchess,
and entered the lists clad in ruby velvet and white
satin, as he figures in the portrait which Titian painted.
This time Christina's presence seems to have inspired
him with unwonted prowess. He broke many lances,
and won a fine gold chain, which he presented to his
cousin. She on her part entertained the King of
the Romans and all the knights who rode in the jousts
at a sumptuous banquet and ball, which ended in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>the Prince presenting rings to all the ladies and receiving
a kiss from each in turn.</p>

<p>This festive evening marked the close of Christina's
visit to Augsburg. The next morning she set out
for Nancy, "leaving the Court sad and widowed,"
writes an Italian chronicler, "bereft of her presence,
and without a lady to amuse the Princes or entertain
the Emperor's guests." Philip escorted her for some
miles on her journey, and took an affectionate farewell
of his favourite cousin, whom he never saw again
until he was the husband of Mary Tudor.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a></p>

<p>Christina's route lay through the duchy of W&uuml;rtemberg
and along the valley of the Neckar. At Esslingen,
the free imperial city on the banks of this river
she met the new English Ambassador, Sir Richard
Morosyne, on his way to Augsburg. In his train
was a young secretary called Roger Ascham. He had
been Lady Jane Grey's tutor, and had left his Greek
studies and pleasant college life at Cambridge with
some reluctance, but was keenly enjoying his first
sight of foreign parts. The journey up the Rhine in
a fair barge with goodly glass windows afforded him
great pleasure. He gazed in admiration at the
castles and abbeys perched on the crags, and the
vines laden with purple grapes that grew in terraces
along the banks, while the river at Spires&mdash;"broader
a great deal than the Thames at Greenwich"&mdash;made
him realize for the first time why the Greeks worshipped
river-gods. In the Court chapel at Brussels
he caught a glimpse of Queen Eleanor,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"looking as fair and white as a dove in her embroidered
linen robe, with her ladies clad in black
velvet with gold chains, and white plumes in their
caps, like boys rather than maidens."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>
<p>Then, as he rode through Tongres, he met the
Queen of Hungary posting back from Augsburg, with
only thirty courtiers in her train, "having outridden
and wearied all the rest, and taken thirteen days to
do a journey that men can scarce do in seventeen!"
"She is a virago," the young Englishman remarked,
"never so well as when she is flinging on horseback or
hunting all day."<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> Now, at Esslingen, Ascham fell in
with another noble lady, "the Duchess of Milan and
Lorraine, daughter to the King of Denmark." Unlike
Mary of Hungary, who posted so fast that no ladies
could keep pace with her, Christina was always attended
with a large retinue. Brant&ocirc;me tells us that at Court
she assumed a state which rivalled that of the Queen
of France herself. On this journey she rode a white
palfrey, and was followed by sixteen maids of honour
on horseback and four chariots filled with ladies,
escorted by a troop of 300 horse. Thirty-six mules
and a dozen waggons, laden with chamber-stuff,
brought up the rear, and a great crowd of "rascals
belonging to her kitchen and stables came drabbling
in the dirt on foot." Roger looked with admiration
at the fine horses with their rich trappings, and was
profoundly impressed by the tall stature and stately
bearing of the Duchess. "I have never seen a lady of
her port in all my life!" he exclaimed. His interest was
heightened when he heard "that she should once have
married King Henry VIII., before my Lady Anne of
Cleves," and was told that she had now been with the
Emperor at Augsburg, "where she was thought by
some to have been a-wooing to the Prince of Spain."<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1550</span>] DISCORD IN IMPERIAL FAMILY</div>

<p>From Esslingen, Christina had intended to go to
Heidelberg, on a visit to her sister, but the unsettled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>state of affairs made her presence necessary at home,
and she hurried on to Nancy. The French were once
more busy with preparations for war, and grew every
day more insolent in their language. Even the Emperor's
old ally, the Constable Montmorency, who had
been recalled to Court by Henry II., joined the war
party, and seemed to be as violent as the Guises.
At the same time fresh trouble was brewing in Germany.
The Interim had proved very unpopular.
Magdeburg refused to accept the new edict, and
Maurice of Saxony, who was sent against the city,
carried on the siege in so half-hearted a manner that
doubts of his loyalty were felt, while the Marquis
Albert kept away from Court and sulked, like Achilles
of old, in his tent. But the worst of all the Emperor's
troubles were those which had arisen in his own
family.</p>

<p>Granvelle confessed to Paget at Brussels that it
had not been easy for Charles to obtain the recognition
of his son as his successor in Flanders, and that
he foresaw this would be a far harder matter in
Germany. From the first, Philip's haughty manners
and Spanish reserve were bitterly resented by the
Princes of the Empire, and Charles realized with
dismay how difficult it would be to obtain their
consent to the adoption of his son as coadjutor of
the King of the Romans, and his ultimate successor
on the imperial throne. He had first of all to reckon
with Ferdinand. This monarch had always been on
the most affectionate terms with his brother, but was
naturally indignant when rumours reached him,
through the Marquis Albert's servants, that the Emperor
intended to make Philip King of the Romans
in his place. In vain his sister Mary assured him that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
this idea had never been entertained. His resentment
was kindled, and he and King Maximilian were prepared
to resist stoutly any infringement of their rights.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a></p>

<p>Everyone noticed how grave and pensive Charles
appeared when he entered Augsburg, and, although
the prolonged family conferences which took place
were conducted in strict secrecy, rumour was busy
with conjecture, and the latest gossip from Augsburg
was greedily devoured at the French Court. At
this critical moment Chancellor Granvelle, who for
twenty-five years had been Charles's most trusted
Councillor, died after a few days' illness at Augsburg.
Friends and foes alike expressed their grief in the
warmest terms. The Constable wrote letters of condolence
to his widow, and Charles and Ferdinand came in
person to visit Madame Nicole, but found this excellent
woman too much overcome with grief to be able to
speak. It was an irreparable loss to the Emperor,
and no one was better aware of this than himself.
"My son," he wrote to Philip, "you and I have lost
a good bed of down."<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Granvelle's son, Antoine
Perrenot, the Bishop of Arras, succeeded him as
imperial Chancellor, but had neither his father's
wisdom nor experience, and was little fitted to cope
with the gravity of the situation.</p>

<p>Charles now sent for the Queen of Hungary, who
hastened to Augsburg in September; but even she
could effect little.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Queen Mary," wrote Stroppiana, the Duke of
Savoy's Ambassador, "is here to persuade the King
of the Romans to accept the Prince of Spain as coadjutor,
but finds the ground very hard, and by what
I hear can obtain nothing."<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1550</span>] THE EMPEROR'S ANXIETY</div>

<p>After Mary's departure, Charles's difficulties increased
every day, and Christina tried in vain to
pour oil on the troubled waters. She amused Philip,
and did her best to console the Emperor in his fits
of profound dejection. When she was gone he turned
once more to Mary, and begged her earnestly to come
to his help.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I had some hope," he wrote on the 6th of December,
"that the King our nephew might be persuaded
to consent to the only plan by which the greatness
and stability of our house can be maintained. But,
as you will see by this letter, which my brother gave
me the day before yesterday, I begin to feel that my
hope was vain. And I think that in this he does me
great wrong, when I have done so much for him.
My patience is almost at an end, and I wish with all
my heart that you were here, as you can help me more
than anyone else. So I beg you to hasten your
coming as soon as possible, and shall await your
arrival with the utmost anxiety."</p></div>

<p>To this letter, which had been dictated to his
secretary, Charles added the following postscript,
written with his own gouty hand:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I can assure you, my dear sister, that I can bear
no more unless I am to burst. Certainly I never felt
all that the dead King of France did against me, nor
all that the present one is trying to do, nor yet the
affronts which the Constable puts upon us now, half
as keenly as I have felt and am feeling the treatment
which I have received from the King my brother.
I can only pray God to grant him good-will and understanding,
and give me strength and patience, in order
that we may arrive at some agreement, and that, if
your coming does not serve to convert him, it may
at least give me some consolation.</p></div>

<p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>

<p>On receiving this letter, Mary started for Augsburg
without a moment's delay. Attended only by the
Bishop of Cambray and three ladies, the brave Queen
rode all the way from Binche to Augsburg in twelve
days, and arrived at five o'clock on the evening of
New Year's Day, 1551.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1551</span>] FAMILY CONFERENCES</div>

<p>All through November and December the Emperor
hardly left his room. When he dined with the
Knights of the Fleece on St. Andrew's Day, the hall
was heated like a furnace, and Marillac, the French
Ambassador, remarked that he looked so old and
feeble he could not be long for this world.<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> But on
the Feast of the Three Kings he dined in public, with
his brother and sister, and his two nephews, Maximilian,
who had arrived from Spain on the 10th of
December, and the young Archduke Ferdinand.
They were, to all appearances, a happy and united
family, and Stroppiana noted an evident improvement
in the Emperor's spirits. Roger Ascham
watched these illustrious personages with keen interest.
He describes how Charles and Ferdinand sat
under the cloth of state and ate together very handsomely,
"his Chapel singing wonderful cunningly all
dinner-time." "The Emperor," he remarked, "hath
a good face, constant air, and looked somewhat like the
parson of Epurstone. He wore a black taffety gown,
and furred nightcap on his head, and fed well of a capon&mdash;I
have had a better from mine hostess Barnes many
times." Ferdinand he describes as "a very homely
man, gentle to be spoken to of any man," the Prince of
Spain as "not in all so wise as his father." But King
Max was Roger's favourite&mdash;"a Prince peerless" in
his eyes. He is never tired of extolling this "worthy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>gentleman, learned, wise, liberal, gentle, loved and
praised of all."<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<p>During the next few weeks prolonged conferences
were held in the Emperor's rooms. King Max from
the first flatly refused to consent to Philip's appointment
as coadjutor with the King of the Romans,
and the quarrel waxed hot between them. Night
and day Arras went secretly to and fro with letters
between Charles and Ferdinand. If the Queen of
Hungary was seen leaving the King of the Romans
with flushed face and flashing eyes, it was a sure sign
that things were going badly for the Emperor. If
Ferdinand and his sons wore a joyous air, and there
were tokens of affection between them and Mary,
Stroppiana and Marillac were satisfied that all was
going well.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> As for Philip and Max, it was easy to
see that there was no love lost between them. They
met occasionally at night in Charles's rooms and
exchanged formal greetings, but never paid each other
visits or attended Mass and took meals together.
The rivalry between the two Princes became every
day more marked.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The King of Bohemia," writes Marillac, "is
frank, gay, and fearless, and is as much beloved by
the Germans as Don Philip is disliked. His Spanish
education, haughty bearing, and suspicious nature,
all help to make him unpopular, although to please
his father he wears German clothes and tries to adopt
German customs, even with regard to drink, so that
two or three times he is said to have taken more than
he could well carry."<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a></p></div>

<p>Nor was Philip more fortunate in his attempts to
distinguish himself in the tilting. In the jousts held
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>at Candlemas, Marillac reports that all jousted badly,
but Philip worst of all, for he never broke a single
lance; and Ascham remarks that the Prince of Spain
"jousted genteelly, for he neither hurt himself, nor
his horse and spear, nor him that he ran with." He
redeemed his character to some extent, however, in
a tournament given a week later in the Queen's
honour, and succeeded in winning one prize; while the
Prince of Orange and Archduke Ferdinand were the
heroes of the day. "And as for noble Max, he ran not
at all."<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a></p>

<p>A few days afterwards the Diet was prorogued,
and Stroppiana told Marillac that owing to Mary's
influence a secret agreement had been framed, by
which Philip was to have a share in the administration
of imperial affairs, and that, when he succeeded
his uncle as Emperor, Maximilian should become
King of the Romans. On the 10th of March an
agreement to this effect was drawn up by the Bishop
of Arras, and signed by all four Princes. On the same
day Mary gave a farewell banquet, after which Ferdinand
took an affectionate farewell of his brother,
and went to Vienna with his sons.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1551</span>] THE EMPEROR DISAPPOINTED</div>

<p>On the 7th of April Mary left for Brussels, after
giving an audience to Morosyne, who saw that "she
was in the dumps," although she smiled two or three
times and tried to hide her feelings.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> By this time
she had probably realized how fruitless all attempts
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>to conciliate the German Princes would prove. The
Electors unanimously declined to sanction the agreement
which had been the cause of so many heart-burnings,
and it remained a dead letter. The Archbishop
of Treves declared that there could only be
one Emperor in Germany and one sun in heaven.
The Palatine, says Morosyne, like the wise old fox
that he was, replied that so important a question
needed time for consideration, and Joachim of Brandenburg
vowed that he would never consent to a
scheme which would be odious to all Germany.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a>
Philip returned to Spain at the end of May, and the
Emperor was reluctantly compelled to accept the
inevitable, and surrender the long-cherished hope
that his son would succeed to his vast empire.</p>


<h3>VI.</h3>

<p>While the eyes of all Europe were fixed on the
imperial family at Augsburg, Christina waited anxiously
for news in her palace at Nancy. She had sent
two of her Italian secretaries, Innocenzo Gadio and
Massimo del Pero, to wait on the Queen of Hungary,
with strict orders to keep her informed of all that was
happening. Gadio's cipher letters have unluckily
disappeared, but some of those addressed to him by
Niccol&ograve; Belloni have recently been discovered in
a private library near Pavia.<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a> Belloni belonged to
a good Milanese family, and had, at his parents'
entreaty, been retained by the Duchess in her service
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>when she left Italy. He had succeeded Benedetto
da Corte as master of her household, and followed
Christina to Lorraine. Niccol&ograve; enjoyed his mistress's
complete confidence, and his letters to Messer
Innocenzo reveal all that was passing in her mind at
this critical moment. On the 2nd of January, 1551,
he writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Honoured Friend</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"Madame's page arrived a few days ago with
your letters, which were most anxiously expected and
gratefully read by Her Excellency. The next morning
she received those which came by Heidelberg, and
yesterday those which you sent by the Flemish servant,
which gave Her Excellency still greater pleasure.
She deciphered them herself, and read them over
several times. You will continue to write as before,
and I will tell you all I hear from other quarters. Do
not fail to report every detail of the difficulties which
are delaying the negotiations, using Madame's ordinary
cipher for this purpose.... I send this messenger by
the post to seek for news, so do not keep him at Augsburg
more than a day, even if Monsignore d'Arras'
letter is not ready, as another courier will be sent in
four or five days. I have received Don Ferrante's
letters, and should be glad to know if my letters for
Fanzoni and Trissino are gone to Milan. Tell Signor
Badoer [the Venetian Ambassador] that I will not fail
to satisfy his curiosity, but it will take some time to
obtain the desired information and will require great
caution.... Send me some fine writing-paper, please&mdash;very
fine, I repeat, because it is for Madame."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1551</span>] BELLONI'S LETTERS</div>

<p>Christina's Milanese servants evidently carried on
a correspondence with their friends at home through
the imperial messengers who were sent from Augsburg
to the Viceroy, and the Princess of Macedonia constantly
despatched packets to Milan and Mantua by
the same channel, while the Duchess herself often
wrote to Don Ferrante regarding the payment of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
dowry and questions affecting the city of Tortona.
A week later Christina sent a Lorraine gentleman,
Monsieur de Saint-Hilaire, to convey her salutations
to the King of Bohemia, on his arrival at Augsburg,
and Belloni took this opportunity to beg Gadio to be
diligent in reporting everything he heard, for Madame's
benefit, assuring him that Her Excellency read his
letters again and again, and believed implicitly in
their contents. On the 12th of February he repeated
the same orders:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It would be well if you would write fuller particulars
of the great matter in hand, above all whatever
you hear of the angry disputes and quarrels which
have arisen between the Prince and the King of
Bohemia, including all the bad language which they
use&mdash;in fact, everything that is said on the subject.
It will all be treated as strictly confidential, and I for
my part know that the King will not be governed by
the Prince, and will use rude and contemptuous words,
as you may imagine! These are the things that Her
Highness wishes to learn from your letters.... I may
possibly take a flight to the Court of France, so, if you
wish to write to me privately, address your letters to
the Princess of Macedonia, who will keep them safely
for me, especially if they come from Italy. Your
letters of the 29th of January and 3rd of this month
have arrived, and are, as usual, most welcome, and
Her Excellency agrees with you that nothing has
really been arranged. Once the business for which
you were sent to Augsburg is settled, Her Excellency
thinks you may as well return, and be sure that you
bring plenty of letters for Her Excellency from all the
world, and a whole waggon-load of news! I am sorry
to hear that your horse has hurt his foot and you
have had to sell him cheap. You must procure
another, and Madame will pay for it all. Only let us
have the truth about these negotiations!"</p></div>

<p>But the Duchess changed her mind again, and Innocenzo
was desired to stay at Augsburg as long as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
Queen was there, even if the King and his sons had left,
in order that she might hear all that her aunt had to
tell of these important matters. Niccol&ograve;'s last letter
to Augsburg is dated the 13th of March, and contains
a reminder to Gadio to bring the writing-paper for
Madame, and to make inquiries about a new method
of coining money at the Imperial Court, which had
excited the Princess of Macedonia's curiosity.<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> The
flight to the French Court which Niccol&ograve; meditated
in March, 1551, was taken in the company of the Count
of Vaudemont, who went to Blois to pay his respects
to the King and Queen, and discover if there were any
truth in the sinister report that Henry II. was planning
the conquest of Lorraine. But he only met with
civil speeches, and found the Court on the eve of a
journey to Brittany, to meet the Dowager Queen of
Scotland, who was coming over to see her child and
visit her aged mother at Joinville. So the Count was
able to allay his sister-in-law's alarms, and, instead
of the dreaded threats of invasion, brought back a
proposal from the King that her son should be affianced
to one of his little daughters. The offer excited
some surprise, considering the strained relations that
existed between Henry II. and Charles V., but Christina
returned a courteous reply, and promised to lay
the matter before the States of Lorraine.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> For the
present she felt that she could breathe freely and give
herself up unreservedly to the enjoyment of a visit
which she was expecting from her sister Dorothea.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1551</span>] THE PALATINE'S VISIT</div>

<p>Since the restoration of peace in Germany, the Elector
Palatine had devoted his time and money to the improvement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>of his ancestral castle at Heidelberg. His
natural love of building found expression in the noble
Renaissance court, with the lovely oriel and grand
Hall of Mirrors, where we may still read "Frau
Dorothea's" name, and the arms of the Three Kingdoms
by the side of the Palatine's lion and the badge
of the Golden Fleece. But the passion for travel and
adventure was still strong in the old Palsgrave's
breast, and when the last stone had been placed on the
lofty bell-tower he and his wife set out, with a great
company of courtiers and ladies, for Lorraine. They
sailed down the Rhine to Coblenz, and, taking horse,
rode through Treves and Metz, where Christina met
them, and the whole party proceeded to Pont-&agrave;-Mousson
and the Count of Vaudemont's castle at
Nom&eacute;ny. Here they attended the christening of the
Countess's daughter, and Frederic stood sponsor, while
his wife was proxy for the French Queen, after whom
the child was named. After a week of festivities, the
party went on to a hunt at Cond&eacute;, the Duke's fair
ch&acirc;teau in the forest on the banks of the Moselle, and
killed five stags. Hubert, who accompanied his
master and gives every detail of the journey, relates
how the Palatine, tired with the day's sport, accepted
a seat in the Duchess's chariot, and how his companion,
Count Jacob von Busch, being a big man,
weighed down the carriage on one side, much to the
amusement of Dorothea, who laughed till the tears
ran down her cheeks. But heavy rains had made
the roads almost impassable, and presently the wheels
caught in a rut and the chariot was upset. The ladies
were covered with mud, and Dorothea's face was
badly scratched; but she made light of the accident,
and only laughed the more as, leaving the lumbering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
coach in the ditch, they mounted horses to ride to
Nancy. At the gates of the city they were met by the
young Duke Charles, a handsome boy of eight, who
lifted his cap with charming grace, and, springing to the
ground, embraced his uncle and aunt, and rode at their
side, conversing in a way that amazed the Germans.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We all wondered," writes Hubert, "at the beauty
and wisdom of the boy, who is indeed remarkably
intelligent, and has been trained by his lady mother
in all knowledge and courtesy."<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1551</span>] TOO LITTLE BEER</div>

<p>His sisters, Ren&eacute;e and Dorothea, received the guests
at the palace gates, "both lovely little maidens," says
Hubert, "only that the youngest is lame and cannot
walk, for which cause her uncle and aunt embraced
her the more tenderly." All the fatigues of the journey
were forgotten in the delights of the week which the
travellers spent at Nancy. The Duchess prepared a
new pastime for each day, and masques, jousts, and
dances, followed each other in gay succession. On the
last day Christina took her guests to the beautiful
grassy vale known as the Ochsenthal. It was a lovely
May morning, and a banquet was served in a green
bower on the banks of the stream. Suddenly a merry
blast of bugles rang out, and, while huntsmen and dogs
chased the deer, two parties of horse galloped up, and,
charging each other, crossed swords and fired guns. "It
might have been an invasion of the Moors!" exclaims
Hubert, who enjoyed the surprise as much as anyone.
At sunset the warriors returned to the palace, where
the fairest maidens of the Duchess's Court crowned
the victors with roses, and danced with them till
morning. The next day Frederic and Dorothea made
the Duchess and her children and servants handsome
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>presents of gold chains and rings and brooches, and
Christina, not to be outdone, gave Hubert a massive
silver tankard, begging him to keep it in remembrance
of her, and continue to serve the Palatine and her
sister as well in the future as he had done in the past.
After this we need not wonder at the glowing pages in
which the honest secretary praises the delicacy of the
viands, the choice flavour of the wines set before the
guests, and the polished manners of the Court of Nancy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Indeed," he adds, "some of our Germans complained
that there was too little beer, because people
here do not sit up drinking all night, and go to bed
like pigs, as we do at Heidelberg."<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a></p></div>

<p>The young Duke and his sisters accompanied the
guests to Lun&eacute;ville, where they spent Whitsuntide
together and took their leave, the little ladies shedding
many tears at parting from their aunt. Even then
Christina could not tear herself from her sister, and the
next day, as the Palatine and his wife were dining at
one of the Duke's country-houses on their route, the
Duchess suddenly appeared, riding up the hill. Hubert
and his comrades ran out to welcome her, waving
green boughs in their hands, and greeted her with
ringing cheers, and they all sat down to a merry meal.
Dorothea begged her sister to accompany her to
Alsace; but the Duchess could not leave home, and
the travellers pushed on that night to Strasburg, and
on the 1st of June reached Heidelberg, where they
were greeted by a gay peal of bells from the new-built
tower. It was the last visit that either Frederic or his
wife ever paid to Lorraine. When the sisters met again,
Christina was an exile and a fugitive, and had lost son
and home, together with all that she loved best on earth.</p>

<h2>BOOK X<br />

THE FRENCH INVASION<br />

1551-1553</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Michaelmas Day, 1551, was memorable, both in
France and Germany, for a snowstorm of extraordinary
severity, followed by an alarming earthquake and
violent tempest, omens, as it proved, of impending
disasters.</p>

<p>In this same month of September, Henry II. recalled
his Ambassador from Augsburg. Ten days later he
declared war. For some time past he had been supporting
Ottavio Farnese, who was in open revolt
against his father-in-law, and carrying on secret intrigues
with Maurice of Saxony and the Protestant
Electors. The Marquis Albert had never forgiven the
Emperor for the affronts of which he imagined himself
to be the victim, and, after vainly offering his sword to
the English King and his hand to Princess Mary, he
went to France as Maurice's emissary. Here he concluded
a secret treaty, which was signed at Friedewald
on the 5th of October by the German Princes, and
ratified at Chambord by Henry II.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1551</span>] INTRIGUES WITH FRANCE</div>

<p>Charles's affairs were in a critical state. The war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>of Parma was a heavy drain on his resources, and had
swallowed up the gold of Mexico and the best Spanish
soldiers, while Maurice's treachery had converted the
strongest body of imperial <i>Landsknechten</i> into foes.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Emperor doth little yet," wrote Roger
Ascham from Augsburg, "but the French be a great
deal aforehand. He is wise enough, but hath many
irons in the fire, and everyone alone to give him work
enough, the Turk by land and sea, the French sitting
on his skirts, beside Magdeburg and the rest."<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a></p></div>

<p>The discontent in Augsburg rose to the highest
pitch when, one day in September, ten preachers were
summarily banished. The imperial residence was
besieged by crowds of furious women, clamouring to
have their babes christened, and guards were doubled
at every gate, while Charles sat within, enfeebled by
gout and reluctant to face the coming peril.</p>

<p>In vain Mary of Hungary warned him of Maurice
and Albert's intrigues with France, and told him that
his incredulity was like to cost him very dear, and
that if he did not take care he would lose, not only
Germany, but also the Netherlands, which were not the
meanest feather in his cap. Both he and Arras refused
to listen. Instead of following his sister's advice and
remaining at Worms or Spires to control Germany
and protect Lorraine, Charles lingered on at Augsburg
after war was declared, and persisted in taking refuge
at Innsbruck. After protracted delays, he at length
left Augsburg on the 21st of October, dragging the
reluctant Ambassadors in his train, and crossed "the
cold Alps, already," sighed Ascham, "full of snow,"
to descend on Tyrol.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>Meanwhile his niece was watching the course of
events with increasing anxiety. All the French
King's fine promises could not allay Christina's fears,
as the autumn months went by, and the din of warlike
preparations sounded louder in her ears. In her
terror she clung to the Guises, hoping that their
influence might save her son and his realm from ruin.
On the 20th of July she went to Joinville to meet the
Dowager Queen of Scotland and stand proxy for
Queen Catherine at the christening of Francis of
Guise's daughter, afterwards the notorious Duchess
of Montpensier. When, in October, the young Duke
of Longueville died suddenly, on the eve of his mother's
departure, Christina once more went to condole with
Antoinette on the loss of her "Benjamin."<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> Both
she and Anne, who came to Nancy at her earnest
request, were full of sympathy for the venerable
Duchess in the trials that clouded her declining years.
A fresh proof of Christina's anxiety to gratify her
powerful relatives appears in a letter which she wrote to
her uncle from Pont-&agrave;-Mousson on the 28th of October,
begging him to grant a request of the Cardinal regarding
the Abbey of Gorzes, which he had lately annexed
to his vast possessions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I could not refuse this petition," she adds, "as
my Lord Cardinal is so near of kin to my children, and
has always treated me and my son with so much kindness
and affection. And I humbly beg Your Majesty
to show him favour, in order that he may see that I
do all that is possible to please him and his house."<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1552</span>] FRENCH INTRIGUES</div>

<p>As the year drew to its close, the insolence of the
French increased, and their incursions and depredations
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>were a perpetual source of annoyance to the people of
Lorraine. At the same time their intrigues fomented discontent
among the nobles, some of whom were annoyed
at the appointment of Monsieur de Montbardon to
be the young Duke's tutor. This French Baron had
originally followed the Constable of Bourbon into exile,
and, after being for many years in the Emperor's
service, had by his wish accompanied Christina to
Lorraine. And both the Regents had good reason to
doubt the loyalty of one of the Lorraine magnates,
Jean de Salm, a son of the late Marshal, commonly
known as the Rhinegrave, who had lately received the
Order of St. Michel from Henry II. All Christina could
do in this critical state of affairs was to keep Mary of
Hungary and the Emperor fully informed of current
events.</p>

<p>On the 7th of January the Sieur de Tassigny, an
agent whom the Queen had sent to Nancy, received a
command from a Court page to come to the Duchess's
rooms that night, in order that she might tell him
certain things which she dared not write. Tassigny
obeyed the summons, and had a long talk with Christina
in the privacy of her own chamber. She told
him that the French were assembling in great force on
the frontier, and that Lorraine would be the first
country to be attacked. And she further informed
him that certain great personages in Germany, the
Marquis Albert, Duke Maurice, and others, were in
secret communication with the King, and were about
to take up arms against the Emperor, and join the
French when they crossed the Rhine. The Rhinegrave
had been often seen going to and fro in disguise
between the King and Duke Maurice. Moreover, a
German had lately told the Duchess that he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
at table with the Elector the day before, and had
heard him vow that he would release his father-in-law,
the captive Landgrave of Hesse, were he at the Emperor's
own side! When another guest warned Duke
Maurice to be more careful, lest his rash words should
be repeated, he replied defiantly: "What I say here
is meant for all the world to hear."</p>

<p>This confidential conversation was faithfully reported
to Mary of Hungary by Tassigny, who concluded
his letter with the following words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"<i>En somme</i>, Madame complains that she is in a
terrible position, seeing that Lorraine will be entirely
at the mercy of the French, and that there is not a
single person in whom she can trust and who is loyal
to His Imperial Majesty, excepting Monsieur de Bassompierre,
her chief Councillor, and Monsieur de
Vaudemont, who is quite alienated from France,
and entirely devoted to the Emperor, saying that it
is impossible to serve two masters."<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1552</span>] LE VOYAGE D'AUSTRASIE</div>

<p>By Christina's wish, Tassigny went on to Nom&eacute;ny
the next day, and had a long interview with Vaudemont,
who assured him that every word spoken by
Her Excellency was true, that at Candlemas there
would be a great revolt in Germany, and that the
French King meant to seize the three bishoprics&mdash;Toul,
Verdun, and Metz. The only way to prevent
this would be for the Emperor to place strong garrisons
in these cities, and thus defeat his enemies' plans. The
Count's information, as time showed, was perfectly
accurate, and, in spite of all that has been alleged to
the contrary, he was probably loyal to the Duchess,
who never doubted his honesty, and to whom he seems
to have been sincerely attached. But he was timid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>and vacillating, and lacked courage and firmness to
face the crisis when it came.</p>

<p>Mary, to whom Christina turned in this extremity,
was powerless to help. Every available man was
needed to defend the Low Countries, and she could
only advise her niece to claim the protection of the
Empire for her son's State, and, if Lorraine were
actually invaded, retire with her children to the Palatinate.
Even Charles began to wake up from his
lethargy, and to realize too late that Mary had been
right all the time. At Christmas Stroppiana wrote
from Innsbruck:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"We begin to suspect the existence of a plot against
the Emperor, hidden under the cloak of a military
revolt. Maurice is not a stranger to this conspiracy,
and Albert has let his soldiers loose and is ravaging
Germany."<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p></div>

<p>A few weeks later Christina's secretary, who kept
Arras informed of all that was happening in Lorraine,
sent the Emperor a message to say that the King was
collecting his forces at Ch&acirc;lons, and that Maurice was
marching on Augsburg at the head of his <i>Landsknechten</i>,
although no one knew whether he meant to fight for
the King or the Emperor.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a></p>

<p>On the 5th of February Henry issued a manifesto,
stamped with the cap of liberty, proclaiming himself
the protector of the Germans and their deliverer from
the Emperor's yoke, and, after solemnly invoking
St. Denis's help, set out for Reims with the Queen and
Dauphin. The gilded youth of France all flocked to
the camp at Ch&acirc;lons, eager to start on the <i>voyage
d'Austrasie</i>, as the expedition was termed by these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>gay spirits, and drive Charles of Austria out of Germany.
The Constable was appointed to the chief
command, Aumale was made Captain of the horse,
and the Rhinegrave Colonel of the German infantry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1552</span>] HENRY II. AT JOINVILLE</div>

<p>As soon as the news reached Nancy, the Duchess
sent Bassompierre to Brussels, and told the Queen
that terror reigned everywhere, although it was
doubtful if Henry would march on Germany or turn
aside to invade Lorraine. The alarm which filled the
hearts of these two defenceless women is reflected in
the letters which Anne and Christina wrote during
these anxious days. The wildest rumours were
abroad, and death and ruin seemed to be staring them
in the face. Bassompierre soon returned with a letter
from Mary, thanking Anne for her valuable information,
and begging her not to desert the sorely-tried
Duchess at this crisis. Since Madame was good
enough to honour her with her commands, Anne
asked nothing better than to obey. She wrote daily
to Brussels, giving minute details of the King's advance.
On the 15th of March he left Reims, and
reached Joinville on the 22nd. From here he sent
Commissioners to Nancy to inform the Duchess that
her towns would not be attacked, and that there was
no need to fortify them. The Regents only raised a
sufficient body of men under the Governor of Nancy,
Baron d'Haussonville, to protect the Duke's person.
Following her aunt's advice, Christina sent one of her
secretaries to Innsbruck to ask the Emperor for assistance;
but Charles could only lament his inability to
come to her help, and advise her to ask the French King
to respect the neutrality of Lorraine. This was her
only hope, and, encouraged by the Cardinal of Guise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
she and Anne went to Joinville on the 1st of April,
and sought an audience from the King.<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a></p>

<p>Here they were received in the kindest manner
by the old Duchess, and conducted into Henry's
presence by the Constable. The King received them
courteously, and conversed some time with them in
a friendly manner. Christina begged him to take her
son under his protection, and reminded him that his
grandmother, Ren&eacute;e de Bourbon, was a Princess of
the blood royal; then, gathering courage, she told him
that she had been accused of designs against him by
slanderous tongues, and asked nothing better than to
show that she was absolutely innocent of these charges.
"So great a lady," remarked the Sieur de Rabutin,
who witnessed the interview, "must have been very
reluctant to plead so humbly, and I doubt if she would
ever have taken a step so contrary to her natural
inclination if her uncle had been able to give her
help."<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> The King listened civilly, and replied that
he bore her no ill-will whatsoever, but was obliged to
secure the frontier and protect himself from danger on
the side of Lorraine. As for her son, he cherished
the most friendly feelings for him, and was anxious to
see him affianced to his own daughter, if the Duchess
were agreeable. This kind language and the
affection shown her by the Cardinal and his mother
relieved Christina's worst fears. She begged the
King to do her the honour of staying under her roof
if he came in that direction, and returned to Nancy
with the Constable, who escorted the two Duchesses
home, in the most amiable fashion, and then went
on to take possession of Toul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>On her return, Christina wrote the following letter
to the Emperor:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"I have been to Joinville in accordance with
Your Majesty's advice, and have sent full particulars of
my interview with the King to Monsieur d'Arras. I
beg you, Monseigneur, to give me your commands as
to my future conduct, as my only wish is to obey
Your Majesty to the end of my life.</p></div>

<p>
"Your very humble and very obedient niece,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 24.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Chrestienne</span>.</span><br />
"From Nancy. April 5, 1552."<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a><br />
</p>

<p>A few days of anxious suspense followed. The
French Queen fell ill of quinsy, and was in danger of
her life. Solemn prayers and litanies were chanted
for her recovery in all the churches, and Diane of
Poitiers hastened to Joinville, where she found the
King "playing the good husband at his wife's bedside."<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a>
But by Palm Sunday Catherine recovered
sufficiently for Henry to leave her in the charge of
Duchess Antoinette and continue his march. On
Monday, the 11th of April, he joined the Constable
before Toul, which opened its gates the next day.
On the 13th the King left the bulk of the army to go
on to Metz with the Constable, and, taking the household
cavalry and a few companies of men-at-arms
under the Duke of Guise, turned his steps towards
Nancy.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1552</span>] THE FRENCH AT NANCY</div>

<p>Eastertide, 1552, was a sad and memorable epoch
in the annals of Lorraine. At two o'clock on Maundy
Thursday, Henry II. entered Nancy at the head of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>his troops, with trumpets blowing and banners flying.
For the first time in the last hundred years, foreign
soldiers were seen within the walls of Nancy. The
Cardinal and the Duke of Guise rode on before, to
inform the Duchess of the King's coming and see
that due arrangements were made for his reception.
Christina nerved herself for a final effort, and with
splendid courage prepared to welcome the enemy of
her race within her palace gates. Salutes were fired
from the bastions as the King entered the town, and
the young Duke rode out to meet him at the head
of the nobles and magistrates, and escorted him to
the church of St. Georges. Here Henry alighted, and
the citizens held a canopy of state over him as he
entered the ancient shrine of the Lorraine Princes,
and, after kissing the relics of the saints on the altar
steps, prayed by the tomb of King Ren&eacute;. Then the
young Duke led him through the stately portal,
under his grandfather's equestrian statue, to the hall
where his mother was waiting to receive her royal
guest, with the Duchess of Aerschot and the young
Princesses. Henry, the Duke of Guise, the Cardinal,
the Marshal St. Andr&eacute;, and 200 gentlemen of the
royal household, were sumptuously lodged in the
ducal palace, while the troops were quartered in the
town, and French guards were stationed at the
gates, not without a protest from Baron d'Haussonville.<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a></p>

<p>That evening the Duchess entertained her guests
at a magnificent banquet in the Galerie des Cerfs,
and the brilliantly-lighted hall, with its vaulted fretwork
of blue and gold, frescoed walls, and rich
tapestries, excited the admiration of all the French.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>
<p>Fran&ccedil;ois de Rabutin, the young Captain in Monsieur de
Nevers's corps of archers, walked through the streets
of the "fine, strong little town," lost in wonder at
the splendour of the palace, the prosperity of the
citizens, and their affection for the ducal family.
More than all he was struck by the young Duke himself,
who appeared to him "the handsomest and
cleverest boy in the world," and who evidently made
the same impression on the King. Henry paid the
Duchess many compliments on her son's good looks
and intelligence, and expressed so much pleasure at
his reception that her worst alarms were allayed.
Late in the same evening she wrote a letter to her
aunt, telling her of the kind expressions used by His
Majesty, and of her hopes that all might yet be well.
But a rude awakening was in store for her. Early
on Good Friday morning Vaudemont appeared at
the door of her room with consternation written on
his face. The King had sent him to inform the
Duchess that her son was to leave Nancy the next
day for Bar, in charge of one of the King's captains,
while she was deprived of all share in the government,
which was henceforth to be administered by Vaudemont
as sole Regent. On receiving this unexpected
message, Christina hastily summoned as many
members of the Council as could be brought together,
and with their help and her brother-in-law's support,
drew up a protest couched in respectful and dignified
language, reminding the King of the terms of the
late Duke's will, and of her own rights both as
mother and Regent. Henry's only reply to this
appeal was to send the Duchess a copy of the
agreement to which she was expected to conform.
It was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duke is to start to-morrow for Bar before
the King leaves Nancy. His mother may accompany
him, or go elsewhere, if she prefers. She may retain
the administration of her son's property, but will no
longer have any authority over the fortresses in Lorraine.
All subjects of the Emperor who hold any
office in the government or in the Duke's household
are commanded to leave Lorraine without delay. A
French garrison of 600 men will be left in Nancy under
Monsieur de Thou, but Monsieur de Vaudemont will
remain Governor of the city, and take an oath to observe
the conditions laid down by the King. A French
garrison of 300 men will also be placed in Stenay
under the Sieur de Parroy."<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a></p></div>

<p>These hard conditions filled Christina with dismay.
She begged the Cardinal to defend her rights, but he
could only advise her to submit to the inevitable.
Both he and Francis of Guise have often been blamed
for not opposing Henry II.'s arbitrary proceedings,
but there seems little doubt that the King originally
intended to reduce Lorraine from the rank of an independent
State to that of a fief of the Crown, and
that it was only the opposition of the Guises which
saved the duchy from this fate. In her despair
Christina made a last attempt to soften the King's
heart. Clad in her black robes and flowing white
veil, she entered the Galerie des Cerfs, where Henry
and his courtiers were assembled, and, throwing
herself on her knees at the King's feet, implored
him, for the love of Christ who died on the cross
that day, to have pity upon an unhappy mother.
The sight of her distress, and the touching words
in which she begged the King to take everything
else, but allow her to keep her son, moved all
hearts, and there was not a dry eye in the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
assembly. Even Henry was filled with compassion,
and, raising the Duchess from her knees, he
assured her that he only wished to confirm the
friendship between the two houses. Far from intending
any harm to the young Duke, he proposed
to bring him up with his children, and to treat him
as if he were his own son, but Lorraine was too
near the frontiers of Germany, and too much exposed
to attacks from his enemies, for him to be
able to leave the boy there. With these consoling
words, he took the weeping Duchess by the hand and
led her to the doors of the gallery, but, as Anne afterwards
told the Queen of Hungary, the King vouchsafed
no reply to her sister's entreaty that she might
not be deprived of her boy, and Christina's prayer
remained unanswered.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>Early the next morning Vaudemont and the Councillors
renewed their oaths of allegiance to Duke
Charles III., after which the young Prince left Nancy
in charge of the French captain Bourdillon and an
escort of fifty men-at-arms. The parting between
the Duchess and her son was heartrending. The
poor mother gave way to passionate tears, in which
she was joined not only by Vaudemont and Anne,
but by all the nobles and people who had assembled
at the palace gates to see the last of their beloved
Duke. Nothing but the sound of weeping and
lamentation was to be heard, and Rabutin, with
all his hatred of the House of Austria, was filled
with compassion at the sight of the Duchess's
grief.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1552</span>] CAPTURE OF THE YOUNG DUKE</div>

<p>On Easter Day Christina wrote the following letter
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>to her aunt, enclosing a copy of the articles drawn up
by the French King:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Madame</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"The extreme grief and distress which the
King's violence has caused me prevents me from
writing to you as fully as the occasion requires; but
I must tell you what has happened since my last
letter, in which I told you of the King's arrival.
Now, in reward for the good cheer which I made him,
he has carried off my son by force, with a violence
which could not have been greater if I had been a
slave. Not content with this, he has deprived me
of the chief part of my authority, so that I can hardly
remain here with honour and reputation, and, what
is worse, I shall no longer have the power of doing
Your Majesty service, which is one of my greatest
regrets. Have pity, Madame, on a poor mother,
whose son has been torn from her arms, as you will
see more fully by this copy of the King's final resolutions,
which he has sent me in writing. These have
been carried out in every particular. Before he left, my
brother, Monsieur de Vaudemont, and all the members
of the Council, except myself, were made to take an
oath, pledging themselves to defend the strong places
in this land against all his enemies, and to open their
gates to him whenever required. The same oath was
taken by the garrison who are to guard this town,
and I was asked to give up the keys of the postern
gate. So that I, who was first here, and could once
serve Your Majesty, am now deprived of all power,
and am little better than a slave. I foresee that I
shall soon be stripped of everything, in spite of the
treaties and agreements formerly made between Your
Majesties and this State. This ill-treatment and the
evident wish shown by the French that I should
leave this house have made me decide to retire to
Blamont, where I will await Your Majesty's advice
as to my future action.... I must warn Your
Majesty, with regard to Stenay, that the new Captain,
Sieur du Parroy, although of Lorraine birth, belongs
to the King's household, and is devoted to French
interests, as is also the second in command. Madame,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
I have written all this to the Emperor, but he is so
far away and in so remote a place that I felt I must
also tell Your Majesty what had happened here,
begging her humbly to let me know her good pleasure.</p>

<p>The letter which Anne addressed to the Queen the
next day is still more graphic in the details it supplies:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1552</span>] THE DUKE AT JOINVILLE</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I cannot help writing to inform you, Madame, of
the utter desolation and misery to which my poor
sister is reduced owing to the great rudeness and
cruelty with which she was treated by the King of
France on Good Friday. He came here under pretence
of good faith and true friendship, as he had
lately given us to understand. On his arrival he
was received with all possible honour and entertained
in the most hospitable manner. On Good Friday
he told Madame that, in order to satisfy the conditions
of his league with the Germans, he must secure all
the fortified posts in Lorraine, as well as the Duke's
person, and with this end must take him to Bar. In
order to prevent this, Madame, Monsieur de Vaudemont
and I, with all the members of the Council, drew up
a remonstrance couched in the most humble terms,
to which he only replied by sending us a written copy
of his resolutions. Upon this my sister went to find
him in the Grande Galerie, and begged him humbly,
even going as far as to fall on her knees to implore
him, for the love of God, not to take her son away
from her. He made no reply, and, to make an end
of the story, Madame, on Easter Eve they took the
boy, escorted by a band of armed men, in charge of
the Sieur de Bourdillon and the Mar&eacute;chal de St.
Andr&eacute;, who did not leave his side until he had seen
him well out of the town. It was indeed a piteous
thing to see his poor mother, Monsieur de Vaudemont,
and all the nobles and this poor people, in tears
and lamentation at his departure. Madame, Your
Majesty can imagine the terrible grief of my poor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>sister at this outrage, and will understand that her
sorrow at losing her son is still so great that I have
been obliged to abandon my intention of returning
home, and feel that I cannot leave her. The King
allows her to keep the charge of her daughters and
the administration of her children's estates, excepting
in the case of the fortified towns, which remain in
the hands of Monsieur de Vaudemont.... And since,
Madame, I am still as ever very anxious to do Your
Majesty service, I beg you to lay your commands
upon me, and they will be obeyed by one who is the
most affectionate servant that Your Majesty will ever
have.</p>

<p>In a postscript Anne further informed Mary that
her sister had just received a letter from the King,
telling her that, hearing an attempt would be made
to carry off the young Duke, he had ordered Bourdillon
to take him to join the Queen at Joinville.
Henry's letter was written from Pont-&agrave;-Mousson,
where he spent Easter Day, after sleeping at the
Duke's country-house at Cond&eacute; on Saturday:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">My Sister</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"After leaving you I received warnings from
several quarters that the Burgundians were going to
make an attempt to surprise Bar and carry off my
cousin, the Duke of Lorraine; and as I am anxious to
prevent this, I ordered Monsieur de Bourdillon to take
him straight to Joinville, which is sufficiently remote
to escape this danger, and where both you and he would
be quite at home in his own family. And you will
find good company there and be given the best of
cheer, just as if I were there myself. I hope, my
sister, that this may be agreeable to you, and that
you will believe that my anxiety for his person is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>the reason why I wish to avoid any risk of injury,
which would be a cause of grave displeasure to those
who love him, as you and I do. Farewell, my sister,
and may God have you in His holy keeping.</p>

<p>The tone of the letter was kind. Henry had evidently
been touched by Christina's distress, and tried
to soften the blow. Fortunately, the little Duke
himself was too young to realize the meaning of these
startling events. The ride to Joinville and the
welcome which he received from the kind old Duchess
amused him, but at bedtime he missed the familiar
faces, and asked for his mother and tutor, Monsieur
de Montbardon. When he was told that they had
stayed at Nancy, the poor child burst into incontrollable
sobs, and refused to be comforted.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1552</span>] CHRISTINA AT DEN&#338;UVRE</div>

<p>The invasion of Lorraine and the harsh treatment
which the Duchess suffered at the French King's
hands were keenly resented by her imperial relatives.
Mary wrote indignantly to Charles at Innsbruck, complaining
justly of Henry's violation of the neutrality
of Lorraine and of the young Duke's<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> capture.
To Christina herself she expressed her anger at the
King's wicked act, at the same time advising her to
bow to the storm and retire to Blamont for the present.
This the Duchess did three days after her son's
departure, taking the two Princesses as well as her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>faithful sister-in-law. Anne's pen was never idle, and
on the following Sunday&mdash;that of <i>P&acirc;ques-fleuries</i>&mdash;she
sent the Queen a list of all the Princes who were
members of the League. But they had not been many
days at Blamont, when their peace was disturbed by
the arrival of the French King and the Constable,
who, after taking possession of Metz, marched through
the Vosges on their way to Strasburg, and took up
their quarters in the castle. The Duchesses left
hurriedly to avoid another meeting with the King,
and moved to Den&#339;uvre, where they remained during
the next three months. But the strain of recent
events had been too much for Christina's strength;
she became seriously ill, and her condition was a
grave cause of anxiety to Anne and her ladies.</p>

<p>Count Stroppiana, who heard the details of the
French invasion from Belloni's own lips at Innsbruck,
wrote the following account of the Duchess's wrongs
to his master, the Duke of Savoy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The King of France, we hear, has occupied Lorraine,
and sent the young Duke to Ch&acirc;lons, guarded
by 100 men-at-arms, contrary to the promises which
he made to the Duchess his mother. She threw herself
at his feet, imploring him not to rob her of her
son, her only joy and consolation, without whom she
could not bear to live, with many other words which
would have moved the hardest heart to pity. The
King would not listen, and repulsed her with many
rough words, forbidding any of the Emperor's subjects
to remain in her service on pain of death. He
has deprived her of the Regency, and relegated her to
a remote country place, where she does nothing but
weep and lament, and will certainly die before long,
if her great sorrow is not comforted, as she has been
ill for some time past. The poor little Duke is said
to be ill, too. When he reached the first stage of his
journey, he asked for his mother and tutor, and, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
he did not see them, wept so bitterly that it was
impossible to comfort him."<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a></p></div>

<p>The boy's tears were soon dried, and he recovered
his spirits in the charge of the Duke of Longueville's
old tutor, Jean de la Brousse, and the companionship
of the royal children. His mother remained long
inconsolable for his loss, but the affection of her son's
subjects was her best solace. So earnest were their
entreaties that she should remain among them that
she declined her aunt's urgent invitation to take
refuge in Flanders, and decided to stay at Den&#339;uvre.
On the 31st of May she wrote as follows to inform
the Emperor of her intention:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Monseigneur</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"At the prayer of my brother Monsieur de
Vaudemont, and my sister the Duchess of Aerschot,
and the earnest desire of my good people, I have been
bold enough to remain here, although Your Majesty
had sent me orders to join the Queens. I trust you
will not take this in bad part, but will understand
that I have only done this at the urgent prayer of
my brother and sister, and not out of disrespect to
your command, since my sole desire is to obey you
all my life, and I beg you to believe this and remember
my son and his poor country.</p></div>

</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">July, 1552</span>] CHRISTINA BANISHED</div>

<p>This letter found the Emperor at the lowest depth
of his fortunes. On the 19th of May he was carried
in his litter by torchlight over the Brenner in torrents
of driving rain, and hardly paused till he arrived at
Villach in Carinthia. A few hours after he left Innsbruck,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>Maurice and his troopers entered the town,
plundered the Emperor's quarters, and robbed the
baggage which had been forgotten in his hasty departure.
The victor might easily have captured the
fugitive Emperor, but, as Maurice said himself, he had
no cage for so fine a bird.</p>

<p>The tide, however, was already turning. Strasburg
closed her gates against the French invaders, and
early in May an Imperial army attacked Champagne
and sent Queen Catherine flying in terror from
Reims. Alarmed by these reports, Henry beat a
hasty retreat, and contented himself with the empty
boast that he had watered his horses in the Rhine.
The seat of the war was now transferred to Luxembourg,
and Lorraine was once more harassed by the
outposts of the two contending armies. From their
safe retreat at Den&#339;uvre, Christina and Anne
watched the course of the campaign anxiously, and
kept up a constant correspondence with Mary of
Hungary. The bold measure of placing an Imperialist
garrison in Nancy was now proposed by the Duchess,
and gladly accepted by her uncle, who realized the
advantages of the scheme, and wrote that Lorraine
might well be occupied, on the ground of the Duke's
detention, and would be restored to him as soon as
he was released.<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Early in July, Christina's trusted
servant, Bassompierre, the Bailiff of the Vosges,
arrived at Den&#339;uvre with a message from Vaudemont,
promising to admit the Imperialist force within the
gates of Nancy on condition that the occupation was
only temporary. The Duchess promptly sent a
lackey to Flanders with a cipher letter to inform the
Queen of his consent. But, as ill-luck would have it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>the servant fell into the hands of the French, who
were besieging Luxembourg, and he was brought
before the King and forced to confess the object of
his errand. Henry was furious at discovering the
plot, and sent a gentleman of his household, Monsieur
de Rostain, to Den&#339;uvre, with a letter to the Duchess,
saying that he feared her attachment to the Emperor
was greater than her maternal love, and desired her
to leave Lorraine without delay. Christina sent one of
her gentlemen, Monsieur de Doulans, back with Rostain
to protest against this order, saying that, after robbing
her of her son and depriving her of the Regency, the
King would surely not be so cruel as to drive her out
of her own dower-house, especially as Den&#339;uvre was
a fief of the Empire. But these passionate appeals
availed her little. A week later Henry sent another
gentleman, Monsieur de Fontaine, to order the Duchess
to leave Den&#339;uvre immediately, if she did not wish to
feel the full weight of his displeasure. This time the
messenger had orders not to return to the King's
presence until he had seen the Duchess across the
frontier. So with a heavy heart the two Princesses
left the land of Lorraine, where they were both so
fondly beloved, and took refuge in Alsace. Belloni,
who sent the Queen an account of his mistress's
latest troubles in his clear Italian handwriting, was
desired to tell her aunt that the Duchess had many
more things of importance to say, but must wait for a
more convenient season. Only one thing she must add,
and this was that through all Monsieur de Vaudemont
had remained perfectly true and loyal to her, although
he was compelled by his office to conform outwardly
to the French King's tyranny.<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a></p>

<p>On receiving this bad news, Mary sent to beg her
niece to come to Flanders without delay, promising the
Duchess a home for herself and her little daughters.
Unfortunately, as Christina found, this was no easy
task. Not only was the whole countryside in peril
of daily attacks from the French, but the Marquis
Albert had descended like a whirlwind from the
Suabian hills, and was spreading terror and destruction
along the banks of the Rhine. The next letter
which she addressed to her aunt from the imperial
city of Schlettstadt, where she had sought refuge,
gives vent to these alarms:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">Madame</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"I received the kind and loving letter which
Your Majesty was so good as to send me on the 6th
of August. It came at the right moment, for I can
assure you that I was sorely troubled, but Your
Majesty's kindness in saying that I shall be welcome
has done me so much good that I feel I do not know
how to thank you enough, and am only sorry I cannot
set out at once. For the roads are very dangerous,
above all for children.... Your Majesty will understand
how distressed I shall be until I can find some
way of coming to you, and certainly one year will
seem to me a hundred, until I am with Your Majesty
once more."<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p></div>

<p>This grateful letter was written from Schlettstadt
on the 22nd of August, and sent to Brussels by Niccol&ograve;
Belloni, the only messenger whom Christina felt
that she could trust. But fresh trouble awaited her
in this direction. Belloni reached Flanders safely,
and came back to Lorraine with letters to the Count
and Countess of Vaudemont, but disappeared in
some mysterious manner two days after he reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
Nancy. It seems doubtful whether he died of the
plague, as Massimo del Pero wrote to his friend
Innocenzo Gadio, or whether he fell into some ambush
and was slain by the enemy's hand. The loss
was a great one to the Duchess, whom he had served
so faithfully and well for the past sixteen years, and
the honest Milanese was lamented by all his colleagues.
Innocenzo Gadio, sent the sad news to the
Princess of Macedonia's daughter, Dejanira, the wife of
Count Gaspare Trivulzio, who had formerly received
Christina in his castle at Codogno. The Countess expressed
her sympathy with her dearest Messer Innocenzo
in the warmest terms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am sure," she wrote, "that the death of so
beloved a friend will cause my mother the greatest
sorrow. When you return to Lorraine," she adds,
"please kiss Her Excellency's hands for me, and tell
her that the sufferings which she has undergone in
those parts grieve me to the bottom of my soul; and
tell her too that we, her servants in this country,
shall always be ready to risk our lives and all that
we have in her service."</p>

</div>

<p>There were still faithful hearts in this far-off land
who never forgot the Duchess whom they had known
in early youth, and who followed her fortunes with
tender sympathy and affection.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1552</span>] AT HOH-K&Ouml;NIGSBERG</div>

<p>But now help came to the sorely-tried Princess
from an unexpected quarter. The Marquis Albert
had haughtily declined to take any part in the conference
that was being held at Passau between King
Ferdinand and Maurice of Saxony, or to be included
in the treaty which was signed between the Emperor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>and the Elector on the 15th of August. Instead of
laying down his arms, he chose to continue his reckless
course, and marched through the Rhineland
plundering towns and burning villages, "making
war," wrote an eyewitness, "as if he were the devil
himself."<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> But when he reached Treves he heard of
the Duchess's expulsion from Lorraine and her distressed
condition, and, with a touch of the old chivalry
that made him dear to women, he promptly sent to
offer her shelter in his castle of Hoh-K&ouml;nigsberg, the
strongest and finest citadel in the Vosges. Christina
accepted the offer gratefully, and during the next
few weeks the red sandstone fortress which still
crowns the heights above Schlettstadt became her
abode. She was there still when the Emperor made
his way from Augsburg to the banks of the Rhine,
at the head of a formidable army.</p>

<p>On the 7th of September he entered Strasburg; on
the 15th he crossed the river and encamped at
Landau. A week before he sent one of his bravest
Burgundian captains, Ferry de Carondelet, to visit
her at Hoh-K&ouml;nigsberg and invite her to visit him
in the camp.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Christina obeyed the summons joyfully,
and a few days after the Emperor reached Landau
she and Anne of Aerschot made their way by
the Rhine to the imperial camp. The Prince of Piedmont
rode out to meet them, and Anne's kinsfolk,
Egmont and d'Aremberg joined with Emanuel
Philibert and Ferrante Gonzaga in welcoming the
distressed ladies and condoling with them on the
terrors and hardships which they had undergone.
Only one thing grieved Christina. The Emperor firmly
refused to admit her trusted Councillor, Bassompierre,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>into his presence, being convinced that he had betrayed
his mistress and played into the French King's
hands. Nothing that she could say altered his
opinion in this respect, and she thought it wiser to
send the Bailiff to Nancy, where he was able to watch
over her interests and send reports to the Queen of
Hungary.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a></p>

<p>Charles was suffering from gout and fever, and
Christina was shocked to see his altered appearance.
The fatigues and anxieties of the last few months had
left their mark upon him. His face was pale and
worn, his hands thin and bloodless, and he spoke
with difficulty owing to the soreness of his mouth
and the leaf which he kept between his lips to relieve
their dryness. Only his eyes kept the old fire, and
no one could divine the thoughts which lay hidden
under the mask-like face. As Morosyne wrote after
an interview which he had with the Emperor about
this time: "He maketh me think of Solomon's saying:
'Heaven is high, the earth is deep, and a king's
heart is unsearchable.'"<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> But he was full of kindness
for Christina, telling her that she and her children
would always find a home at Brussels. Since, however,
her cousin of Guise had entrenched himself in Metz
and the country round was swarming with soldiery, he
advised her to remain at Heidelberg for the present.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1552</span>] CHARLES. V. AND ALBERT</div>

<p>The Duchess obeyed this advice and retired to her
brother-in-law's Court. The Palatine was growing
old, his beard had turned white and his strength
began to fail, but his influence was as great as ever
in Germany. Morosyne, who met him at Spires, pronounced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>him to be the wisest and best of all the
Electors, and was touched by the affection with which
he spoke of the late King Henry VIII., declaring that
his shirt never lay so near his skin as King Edward's
noble father lay near his heart. The Ambassador's
secretary, Roger Ascham, made friends with Hubert,
who sent him long dissertations on the pronunciation
of Greek, and invited him to Heidelberg. Now
Frederic and his wife welcomed the Duchess and her
children with their wonted hospitality, and insisted
on keeping them until the end of the year; but Christina's
heart was with her poor subjects, who suffered
severely from the ravages of the war. From Nancy,
Bassompierre sent word that the Marquis Albert had
suddenly deserted his French allies, and had captured
Aumale and carried him in triumph to the imperial
camp before Metz.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a></p>

<p>Here, on the 20th of November, Charles came face
to face with the man who had wronged him so deeply.
"God knows what I feel," he wrote to Mary, "at
having to make friends with the Marquis Albert, but
necessity knows no law."<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> At least, he accepted the
situation with a good grace. Morosyne was present
when the Emperor came riding into the camp on a
great white horse of Naples breed, and, seeing Albert,
took his hand with a gracious smile, and shook it
warmly twice or thrice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Marquis fixed his eyes fast on the Emperor's
countenance, as one that meant to see what thoughts
his looks betrayed. When he saw that all was well,
or at least could not see but all seemed well, he spake
a few words, which His Majesty seemed to take in
very good part."</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>Calling a page to his side, he took a red scarf, the
Imperialist badge, from his hands, and gave it to the
Marquis. Albert received it with deep reverence,
saying that he had not fared badly when he wore
these colours before, and trusted the Emperor's gift
would bring him the same good fortune as of old.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1553</span>] THE EMPEROR TO RETURN</div>

<p>The return of the wanderer saved Charles from
utter ruin. His affairs were still going badly. Vieilleville,
the French Governor of Verdun, seized the boats
laden with provisions for the imperial camp, which
Christina had sent down the Rhine, and laid violent
hands on six waggons of choice fruits, wines, and
cakes, which were despatched from Nancy for her
uncle's table. Worse than this, he contrived to
enter Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, which Fabrizio Colonna held,
disguised as a messenger from the Duchess, and
obtained possession of this important place by
stratagem.<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The valour of Guise and the strong
fortifications of Metz were proof against the reckless
courage of Albert and the might of the imperial
army. The heavy rains and biting cold of an
early winter increased the sufferings of the troops,
and, after losing half his army by famine and dysentery,
Charles was compelled to raise the siege at the
New Year. "Fortune is a woman," he remarked to
one of his captains; "she abandons the old, and keeps
her smiles for young men."<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> In this forced retreat
the Marquis performed prodigies of valour, and succeeded
in bringing his guns safely over roads rendered
impassable by a sudden thaw. The bulk of the army
was dismissed, only the veteran Spanish and German
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>forces being quartered in Artois and Luxembourg,
and Charles himself set out for Brussels. His failing
strength compelled him to halt on the way, and
Morosyne gave it as his opinion that the Emperor
would never reach the end of his journey alive. But
his spirit was indomitable as ever, and on Sunday,
the 6th of February, he entered Brussels in an open
litter, amid scenes of the wildest enthusiasm.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To-day," wrote the Ambassador of Savoy, "I
have witnessed the safe arrival of the Emperor. He
was received with the greatest transports of joy and
delight by the whole people, who feared that he was
dead and that they would never see him again."</p></div>

<p>And Charles himself wrote to Ferdinand that, now
he was once more in his native land and in the company
of his beloved sisters, he would soon recover
his health.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<h2>BOOK XI<br />

CHRISTINA AT BRUSSELS<br />

1553-1559</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>Christina was at Brussels on the memorable day
when the Emperor set foot once more on his native
soil. She heard the shouts of joy which rent the
air, and joined with the Queens in the welcome which
greeted him on the threshold of his palace. Early
in January she had left Heidelberg and travelled
safely down the Rhine and through the friendly states
of her Cleves cousins to Brussels. Here she occupied
the suite of rooms where she had lived
before her second marriage, and to a large extent
resumed her former habits. She spent much of her
time with her aunts and the Duchess of Aerschot,
and renewed her old friendship with Countess d'Aremberg
and other ladies of the Court. The deepest
sympathy was felt for her by all classes, and when
Charles addressed the States-General on the 13th of
February, and alluded to the treachery of the French
in carrying off the young Duke of Lorraine and driving
his mother out of the realm, his words provoked an
outburst of tumultuous indignation.<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1553</span>] CHRISTINA'S SUITORS</div>

<p>Through her brother-in-law Vaudemont she still
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>maintained close relations with Lorraine, while the
Cardinal kept her informed of all that concerned her
son, and the boy's own letters satisfied her that he was
well and happy at the French Court. But although
Charles shared all the advantages enjoyed by the
King's children, and soon became a general favourite
in the royal family, it was bitter for the Duchess to
feel that her only son was growing up, in a foreign
land, among the hereditary foes of her race. The
restoration of peace between Charles and Henry
was the only means by which she could hope to
recover her lost child, and this became the goal of
all her efforts during the six years that she spent in
exile.</p>

<p>The Widow of Milan had been courted by Kings and
Princes, and hardly was Christina settled at Brussels
before she was assailed by fresh offers of marriage.
Henry, King of Navarre, whose accomplished wife
had died soon after her daughter's marriage, asked
the Emperor for his niece's hand, but his proposals
met with small favour. Far more serious was the
courtship of Albert of Brandenburg, who felt this to
be a favourable moment for renewing his old suit.
"No one," as Thomas Hoby wrote, "had done the
Emperor worthier or more faithful service" in the
siege of Metz, and was better entitled to reward. His
claims were strongly supported by the Palatine, who
invited the Marquis to Heidelberg to confer with the
other German Princes on the best means of recovering
Metz. Albert himself not only aspired to the
Duchess's hand, but to the Duke of Alva's post of
Commander-in-Chief, and boasted that once Christina
was his bride he would easily recover her father's
kingdoms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It is supposed," wrote Morosyne from Brussels
on the 20th of February, "that the Marquis will
marry the Duchess of Lorraine and have Alva's place.
The Palsgrave would fain it were so, in order that, if
the Marquis married his wife's sister, he might help
him to recover Denmark; for besides that a slender
title is apt to set such a one to work, he should, by
being married to the Emperor's niece, and afterwards
coming, when his uncle died, to the duchy of Prussia,
be able easily to trouble Denmark. The Marquis
doth much desire it, for that the Duke of Holstein has
been and is a great suitor to the Duchess, who was
once so nigh marrying the Marquis Albert's sister that
the contracts were drawn up and put into writing, but
broke it off upon sight of the Duchess of Lorraine.
The Palsgrave would rather any did marry with her
than the Duke of Holstein, for that his brother, King
Christian, keeps his wife's father in prison. And the
Emperor, it is held certain, will help it, in order that
he may by this means trouble Denmark, which he has
never had leisure to trouble himself."<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1553</span>] PHILIP HOBY'S AUDIENCE</div>

<p>Whatever her relatives may have thought of the
Marquis's suit, Christina herself never considered it
seriously, and told the Palatine plainly that such a
marriage was out of the question. The Marquis
vented his anger on the Emperor, and left Heidelberg
in high displeasure, without taking leave of the Palatine
or anyone else. Hot words passed between him
and Maurice, and these two Princes, who had once been
the closest friends, were henceforth bitter enemies.
Albert returned to his life of raids and plunder,
and when, soon afterwards, he was placed under
the ban of the Empire, Maurice led an army against
him. A fiercely-contested battle was fought on the
9th of July at Sievershausen, in which Albert was
completely routed and Maurice lost his life. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>Marquis was deprived of fortune and patrimony, his
ancestral home of Plassenburg was burnt to the
ground, and after leading a roving life for some years,
and wandering from one Court to another, he died in
the house of his brother-in-law, the Margrave of
Baden, on the 8th of January, 1557. So in exile and
poverty this brave and brilliant adventurer ended his
career, before he had completed his thirty-fifth year.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a></p>

<p>While the Palatine was holding vain conferences at
Heidelberg, and the Marquis and Duke Adolf were
still quarrelling for the Duchess's hand, she herself was
endeavouring to open negotiations with the French
King through Bassompierre and Vaudemont. But
nothing would induce Henry to give up Metz, and in
April war was renewed with fresh vigour. The young
Prince of Piedmont, who succeeded the unpopular
Alva in command of the imperial army, won a series
of victories, and razed the forts of Th&eacute;rouenne and
Hesdin to the ground. But the Emperor was too ill
to take part in the campaign or even to give audiences.
Sir Philip Hoby, who now succeeded Morosyne,
actually believed him to be dead, until De Courri&egrave;res
came to dine with his English friends, and assured
them, on his honour as a gentleman, that he had seen
the Emperor alive that morning.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> Upon this Sir
Philip's brother Thomas, who had just arrived from
Paris, where he had been spending the winter in
translating Castiglione's "Cortegiano," was sent to
see his old Augsburg friend, the Bishop of Arras, and
beg for an audience. At length, on the 8th of June,
the Englishmen were admitted into the privy
chamber, and found the Emperor sitting up, with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>feet on a stool, "very pale, weak, and lean, but nothing
so ill as they had believed." His eye was lively, his
speech sensible, and his manner very friendly and
agreeable. But, although he expressed an earnest
wish for peace, he declared that the French demands
made this quite impossible.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1553</span>] ACCESSION OF MARY</div>

<p>A month later an unexpected event produced a
change in the Emperor's fortunes. King Edward VI.
died, and, after a vain attempt on Northumberland's
part to set Lady Jane Grey on the throne, Catherine
of Aragon's daughter Mary succeeded peaceably to
the throne. Her accession was hailed with joy at the
Imperial Court, and on the Feast of St. Bartholomew
the Regent celebrated the event by giving a banquet,
to which the English Ambassadors were invited. "It
was such a dinner," writes Hoby, "as we had seldom
seen in all our lives, and greater good cheer or entertainment
than Her Grace gave us could not be devised."
Mary was in high spirits that evening. She
toasted the Ambassadors, conversed with them after
dinner for more than an hour, and told Morosyne
laughingly that his French could not be worse than
her Italian. Sir Philip sat next to the Duchess of
Lorraine, and reminded her of the memorable morning,
fifteen years before, when he brought the German
Court painter to take her portrait.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> Since then much
had happened. King Henry himself, the great painter
Holbein, Ren&eacute; of Orange, and Francis of Lorraine,
were all gone, and she had lost home and state and
had seen her only son snatched from her arms. Yet
she was still beautiful and fascinating, and counted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>almost as many suitors as of old. Adolf of Holstein
wooed her with a constancy which no coldness could
repel, and if the wild Marquis had been forced to
renounce all hope of winning her hand, another hero,
the young Prince of Piedmont, was ready to lay his
laurels at her feet. But Christina remained the same,
calm and unmoved, and was an interested and amused
spectator of the matrimonial plans which now formed
the all-absorbing topic in the family conclave.</p>

<p>Charles quickly realized the importance of securing
the new Queen's hand for his son. As soon as he
heard of Edward's death, he sent orders to his Ambassador
at Lisbon to delay drawing up the marriage
contract which had been agreed upon between Philip
and Eleanor's daughter, Maria of Portugal, and wrote
to his son, setting forth the superior advantages of
the English alliance. Philip replied dutifully that, as
his cousin the Queen was twelve years older than
himself, his father would be a more suitable husband,
but added that he was ready to obey the Emperor's
will in all respects.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a></p>

<p>On the 20th of September Charles wrote from
Valenciennes, where he was directing military operations
from his litter, to the English Queen. After
explaining that he was too old and infirm to think of
marriage, and had solemnly vowed after the Empress's
death never to take a second wife, he offered her the
dearest thing he had in life&mdash;his own son. He then
proceeded to point out the great advantages of the
proposed union, while at the same time he advised
Mary to observe the utmost caution, being "well
aware of the hatred with which the English, more than
any other nation, regard foreigners." Mary's own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
mind was soon made up. In spite of protests from
her subjects and remonstrances from the French
King, she was determined to marry her cousin. On
the 30th of October she sent for the Imperial Envoy,
Renard, and, kneeling down before the Blessed Sacrament
in her chapel, she said the <i>Veni Creator</i>, and
took a solemn vow to wed the Prince of Spain.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1554</span>] CARDINAL POLE AT BRUSSELS</div>

<p>The most friendly letters were now exchanged
between the two Courts. The holy chrism for Mary's
coronation was sent from Brussels, with venison and
wild-boar for her table. Charles gave his future
daughter magnificent tapestries and jewels, and Mary
of Hungary sent the Queen a yet more precious gift,
Titian's portrait of Philip, telling her that, if she stands
at some distance from the canvas, it will give her a good
idea of the Prince, only that he is older and more
bearded than he was when the artist painted it three
years ago. The Regent took care to add that she could
only lend the Queen the picture on condition that it
should be returned "when the living man joined her."
In reply, Mary begged her good aunt to pay her a
visit; but the Regent excused herself, owing to the
Emperor's ill-health, and promised to come and see
her later on, it might be in the Prince's company.
The same cordial invitation was extended to the
Duchess of Lorraine, who sent her new <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>,
Baron De Silliers, to London in April, 1554, to congratulate
the Queen on her marriage. Mary made
Christina a present of a fine diamond, which De
Courri&egrave;res was desired to give her, and when, on the
20th of July, Philip landed at Southampton, and the
wedding was celebrated in Winchester Cathedral, the
happy spouse sent costly jewels to the Emperor and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>the two Queens, and a beautiful emerald to her dear
cousin the Duchess.</p>

<p>In January Cardinal Pole, the Papal Legate, came
to the monastery of Diligam, near Brussels, with proposals
of peace from the Pope, on his way to congratulate
Queen Mary on her accession, and help
to restore Catholic rites in the kingdom. Pole was
known to be averse to the Spanish marriage, and
Charles had put every obstacle in the way of his
journey to England. On his arrival he gave him a
very cold reception, and the Cardinal complained to
the Pope that the Emperor and Arras could not have
used greater violence, unless they had taken a stick
to drive him back.<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> The Regent and the Duchess of
Lorraine, however, were much more friendly when he
dined with them the next day, after attending Mass
in the royal chapel. Mary told him that no one
wished for peace more earnestly than herself, seeing
how terribly her poor people of the Netherlands had
suffered from the war, and Christina spoke to him of
her son with tears in her eyes. When the Cardinal
went on to Fontainebleau, he saw the young Duke,
and was able to give him his mother's messages. But
he found Henry II. still less amenable than Charles,
and returned to Brussels convinced that his mission
was a failure as far as the hope of peace was concerned.</p>

<p>Before the end of April the French King invaded
Hainault, at the head of a large army, and took the
strong citadel of Marienburg. Namur was only saved
by the promptitude of Charles, who once more took
the field, although he could no longer mount a horse,
and showed all his old courage in this his last campaign.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span></p>
<p>After an indecisive battle at Renty, the
French retired with heavy loss, spreading famine and
desolation in their track. One act of vandalism for
which Henry was condemned, even by his own captains,
was the destruction of Mary of Hungary's
beautiful palace of Binche, with its famous gardens
and treasures of art. The Queen received the news
with equanimity, saying that she was proud of being
the object of the French King's vindictiveness, and
glad the world should know that she was the Emperor's
devoted servant.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As for the damage which has been done," she
wrote to Arras, "I do not care a straw. I am not
the woman to grieve over the loss of things transitory,
which we are meant to enjoy as long as we have them,
and do without when they are gone. That, upon my
word, is all the regret I feel."<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a></p></div>

<p>In the autumn Christina made another fruitless
attempt to open negotiations through Vaudemont,
who after the death of his first wife, Margaret of
Egmont, was induced by the Cardinal of Lorraine to
marry the Duke of Nemours's daughter. This Prince
came to Brussels in November to inform the Emperor
and the Duchess of his marriage, and, as might be
expected, met with a very cold reception at Court.
But, in spite of his French alliance, he remained scrupulously
loyal to Christina and her son, and complained
to his sister Anne that at Brussels he was reproached
for his French sympathies, while in Paris he was
looked on with suspicion as an Imperialist. So hard
was it to be an honest man in those troublous times.<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>While the war dragged on its weary course, and
Mary and Christina vainly tried to bring it to an
end, on the other side of the Channel the new King
of England and his spouse were holding high festival.
They came to London in September, and remained
there through the winter, trying to win the love of
their subjects by a series of popular displays and
festivities. Tournaments were held at Whitehall,
hunting-parties were given at Windsor and Hampton
Court, and a succession of distinguished guests travelled
from Flanders to pay homage to the royal pair.
Philip's favourite, Ruy Gomez, and the Duke and
Duchess of Alva, arrived from Spain, Ferrante
Gonzaga, the Prince of Orange, and the Grand Equerry
Boussu, came over from Antwerp during the
autumn.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> On the 20th of November Cardinal Pole
at length crossed the Channel; four days later he
was received at Whitehall by the King and Queen
in person, and crossed the river in the royal barge, to
take possession of his own house at Lambeth. He
was soon followed by Emanuel Philibert, who had
lately succeeded to the barren title of Duke of Savoy
on his father's death, and had been made a Knight
of the Garter. Earlier in the summer he had paid
a brief visit to London, where his white, red, and
green banners of Savoy made a fine show in the
Abbey on St. Peter's Day; but as his military duties
rendered his presence in Flanders imperative, his
Ambassador, Stroppiana, came to Windsor in October,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>to be invested with the Garter<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> as proxy for his
master.</p>

<p>It was not till Christmas Eve that the Duke himself
landed at Dover, after a very rough passage, and made
his way to Whitehall, where Philip and Mary received
him with great honour, and showed him all
the sights of London. On the 7th of January the
Lord High Admiral took him by water to see the
great guns at the Tower, and on St. Paul's Day he
accompanied the King and the Cardinal in state
to the Cathedral for the patronal feast. A procession
of 160 priests bearing crosses, walked round
the churchyard, with the children of Paul's School
and the Greyfriars, singing "Salve, Festa Dies!"
and passed in through the great west doors. After
Mass a state banquet was held, with great ringing
of bells, and bonfires blazed in all the streets of
London throughout the night.<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1555</span>] A ROYAL GODMOTHER</div>

<p>Emanuel Philibert's visit revived the rumour of a
marriage between him and the Princess Elizabeth,
which the Emperor had suggested some months before.
Whether from policy or genuine regard, Philip had
espoused his sister-in-law's cause and refused to allow
Mary to send her abroad or keep her away from Court.
The Duke of Savoy was a pleasant and good-looking
Prince, whose martial appearance and genial manners
made him very popular in England. But Elizabeth
herself quite declined to listen to this proposal,
saying that she would never marry a foreigner,
and, since there now seemed good hope of the birth
of an heir to the crown, the question of the succession
was no longer of the first importance. Something,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>however, must be done to pacify the Duke, who complained
bitterly of the Emperor's neglect, and, seeing
little chance of recovering Savoy, asked the King for
the viceroyalty of Milan, which Ferrante Gonzaga, on
his part, refused to surrender. Philip could think of
no better plan to gratify his cousin and retain his
services than to give him the hand of the Duchess of
Lorraine, a Princess whom he was known to regard
with great affection.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a></p>

<p>Accordingly the King and Queen sent pressing
invitations to Christina, begging her to come to
England as soon as possible. Before she could
comply with their request, she had to keep an old
engagement to be present at the christening of Count
Egmont's infant daughter, which took place on the
evening of the 19th of January. The Queen of
England had graciously consented to be one of the
godmothers, while the Duchess of Lorraine was the
other, and the Palatine Frederic stood godfather to
his kinswoman's little daughter. Mary wrote to the
Duchess of Aerschot, begging Anne to represent her
on this occasion, and sent a costly gold cup containing
forty angels to her godchild by the new Ambassador,
Sir John Masone. The Palsgrave, not to be outdone,
sent the child a diamond cross, and another
one, set with rubies, diamonds, and emeralds, to the
mother. Anne and Christina were both present at
the christening, which was attended by all the Court,
"everything," wrote Masone, "being very richly
ordered, the supper and banquet right stately, and
Her Majesty's cup so walked up and down, from man
to woman, and woman to man, as I dare answer few
were there that did not go full freighted to bed."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir John further told the Countess in what good
part her request to make her daughter a Christian
woman had been taken by his royal mistress, who
would willingly have done the same in person, had
the distance not been so great, and Sabina sent her
most humble thanks to the Queen, saying that, as she
already had one daughter called Mary, she had
decided to name the infant Mary Christina, after her
two godmothers.<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1555</span>] CHRISTINA'S GOOD WISHES</div>

<p>When this function was over, Christina began to
prepare for her journey to England, but the weather
was so tempestuous that she did not cross the Channel
until the first days of March. She rode from Dover,
by way of Canterbury, to London, where the King
and Queen received her in the most cordial manner,
Philip made no secret of his affection for his cousin,
the only woman in his family with whom he had ever
been intimate, and Mary, in the first flush of her
wedded happiness and in the proud expectation of
soon being a mother, welcomed Christina warmly.
Unluckily, we have no particulars of the Duchess's
visit to this country, over which she might have
reigned herself as Queen. We know that she was
present with the rest of the Court at the great joust
held on Lady Day in the tilting-yard at Whitehall,
when Philip and a band of knights, armed with
falchions and targets, and clad in blue and yellow,
rode out against two other troops in red and green,
and some 200 lances were broken.<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> But the only
record that we have of this her first visit to England
is a letter which she wrote to Mary on returning to
Flanders. She thanked the Queen for the great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>honour and kindness which she had shown her, and
commended the captain of the ship in which she
sailed, who, as Her Majesty would doubtless learn,
had rendered her notable service on this troublesome
passage:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I will say no more," she adds, "except to regret
that I am no longer in Your Majesty's presence to
be able to render you some small service in return
for all the goodness which I have received at your
hands. I beg God, Madame, to send you good health
and long life, and give you a fine boy, such as you
desire.</p>

<p class="right">
"Your very humble and obedient cousin<br />
and servant,<br />
"<span class="smcap">Chrestienne</span>.</p>
<p>
"A la Royne."<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>This letter bears no date, but the Duchess certainly
left London before the King and Queen went to
Hampton Court on the 4th of April, to spend Easter
and prepare for the happy event which all England
was anxiously expecting. She was at Antwerp with
her aunt a month later, when, on the 3rd of May,
"great news came over the seas." A messenger from
the English ships in the port brought the Regent
word that the Queen of England had been "brought
to bed of a young Prince," upon which all the guns
in the harbour were fired, and Mary ordered the
big bells in the Tower to be rung, and sent the English
sailors a hundred crowns to drink the royal infant's
health. "I trust in God," wrote Sir Thomas
Gresham, "that the news is true." The Emperor
was more incredulous, and summoned Masone to his
bedside at 5 a.m. the next morning, to know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
he thought of the matter, but soon satisfied himself
that the news was false.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p>

<p>The Savoy marriage, which Philip was so anxious
to bring about, also ended in smoke. During Christina's
visit, the matter was brought forward and
eagerly urged both by the King and Queen. Charles
was no less anxious for the marriage, and Mary of
Hungary proposed to appoint the Duke, Governor of
the Low Countries when she resigned the office. The
plan would have been very popular in Flanders,
where the Duchess was beloved by all classes, and
was warmly supported by Egmont and Orange. On
the 1st of May, Badoer, the Venetian Ambassador at
Brussels, announced that the marriage contract had
already been drawn up by De Praet, and that the
Duke had started for Italy, disguised as a German,
and only attended by one servant, to arrange his
affairs in Piedmont before the wedding.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1555</span>] DUKE OF SAVOY'S MARRIAGE</div>

<p>The Venetian's news was apparently premature,
but a fortnight later a Piedmontese noble, Count
Avignano, came to London to consult Philip as to
the marriage and arrange further details on his
master's behalf. He talked freely at table to the
French and Venetian Ambassadors, Noailles and
Michieli, saying that the Emperor had offered his
master the government of the Netherlands with the
hand of Madame de Lorraine, an arrangement which
he for his part regretted, thinking that the Duke
would be more likely to recover his dominions if he
married in France. But, since the friendship between
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>his lord and the Duchess was so great, he saw no
hope of any other alliance, and the marriage was, in
fact, considered by the Emperor and all his family
to be practically settled.<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a></p>

<p>Emanuel Philibert, like many others, evidently
felt the power of Christina's fascination, and enjoyed
a large share of her intimacy. But he does not seem
to have shown any great eagerness for the marriage,
whether it was that, as Avignano said, it would be
a bar to the recovery of his States, or whether he
recognized the Duchess's own insuperable objection
to matrimony.</p>

<p>When, towards the end of May, a party of English
Commissioners met the French and Imperial deputies
at Marck, a village near Calais, to treat of peace, an
offer was made by the French to give Henry II.'s
sister Margaret to the Duke of Savoy. The Imperial
deputies expressed a doubt if this were possible, as
the Duke's word was already pledged; but Cardinal
Pole replied that the Prince was quite free, and ready
to agree to any proposal by which he could recover his
realm. These negotiations, however, were soon broken
off, and on Philip's return to Brussels in September
the old scheme of the Lorraine marriage was revived
with fresh ardour. When the Duke of Savoy returned
from Italy in August, the Regent made him attend
the meetings of the Council, and treated him in all
ways as her future successor, hoping by this means
to obtain his consent to her wishes. But both
Emanuel Philibert and Christina remained of the
same mind, and neither Philip's entreaties nor Mary
of Hungary's angry reproaches could alter their
resolution. The Duke pleaded poverty as an excuse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
lamenting his inability to offer his wife a home and
station worthy of her rank, and was evidently determined
to sacrifice his affections to political expediency,
although, as the French Ambassador reported,
"he still made love through the window to
Madame de Lorraine."<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<p>Charles V.'s intention to abdicate his throne had
long been declared. For many years he had looked
forward to the time when he should lay down the
burden of public affairs and retire from the world, to
end his days in some peaceful cloister. The increasing
infirmities under which he groaned, his
inability to attend either camp or council, and finally
the death of his mother, Queen Joanna, in April,
1555, all helped to hasten the execution of his resolve.
Only the continuation of the war and the absence
of his son still made him hesitate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1555</span>] PHILIP LEAVES ENGLAND</div>

<p>The same indecisive warfare as before was carried
on through the year. The Prince of Orange, who
now held the chief command, succeeded in keeping
the foe at bay, and built the citadels of Charlemont
and Philippeville for the defence of the frontier.
But everyone was heartily tired of the campaign,
and both parties gladly availed themselves of the
opportunity afforded by an exchange of prisoners,
to renew negotiations in the autumn. Christina
once more exerted herself in this direction, and
Vaudemont, who came to Brussels in October to
take leave of the Emperor, was employed to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>fresh overtures to the French King. But many
months passed before any conclusion was reached.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">[503]</a></p>

<p>Charles had always hoped that his sister would
remain at her post when he left the Netherlands,
feeling how invaluable her help would prove to Philip.
But Mary was inflexible on this point. In a noble
letter which she wrote at the end of August, she
reminded him that fifteen years before she had begged
to be released from her arduous post in order to
devote herself to the care of her unhappy mother,
and that, now this privilege could no longer be hers,
she wished to spend the rest of her life in Spain with
her sister, Queen Eleanor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"And however great," she adds significantly, "my
affection for the King my nephew may be," in
Badoer's graphic phrase, "he hates and is hated by
her"&mdash;"Your Majesty will understand that at my
age it would be very hard to begin learning my ABC
over again. A woman of fifty, who has held office
twenty-four years, ought, it seems to me, to be content
to serve one God and one Master for the rest of her
life."<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a></p></div>

<p>There was nothing more to be said, and Charles
agreed to Philip's wish that for the present the Duke
of Savoy should be appointed Lieutenant-Governor
of the Low Countries. At length Philip succeeded
in tearing himself from the arms of his sorrowful
Queen, promising to be back in a fortnight or three
weeks. From her palace windows at Greenwich,
Mary waved her last farewells to the King, as he
sailed down the Thames. He for his part was nothing
loth to leave his fretful and melancholy wife, and
was satisfied that she would never bear him a child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 8th of September he reached Brussels, and
went straight to see his father in the Casino, near
the Louvain gate of the park, where he was spending
the hot weather. Charles embraced his son tenderly,
and after an hour's conversation Philip went on to
sup with Queen Mary and Christina on their return
from hunting. On the 17th and 18th he attended
the Requiem Masses held in S. Gudule for the late
Queen Joanna, and afterwards joined in a grand
hunting-party given by the Regent in his honour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1555</span>] THE EMPEROR'S ABDICATION</div>

<p>The nobles now flocked to Brussels to be present
at the Emperor's abdication. The Prince of Orange
arrived from the camp near Li&eacute;ge, and his young wife,
Anne of Egmont, was hospitably entertained by the
Duchess of Aerschot. Friday, the 25th of October,
was the day fixed for the great ceremony. On this
afternoon, at three o'clock, the Emperor left the
Casino with Philip and the Duke of Savoy, and rode
to the palace on his mule. An hour later he entered
the great hall, hung with the tapestries of Gideon's
Fleece, wearing his mourning robes and the collar of
the Order, and leaning on the Prince of Orange's
arm. He was followed by Mary of Hungary, Philip,
and the Duke of Savoy, who took their places on the
da&iuml;s at the Emperor's side, while the Knights of the
Fleece, the great nobles and Ambassadors, occupied
seats below. The deputies, over a thousand in
number, who thronged the hall, rose to their feet to
receive the Emperor, and then sat down to hear the
chief Councillor, Philibert of Brussels, deliver a
speech, explaining the reasons for His Majesty's
abdication. Then Charles himself addressed the vast
assembly. In moving words he recalled the day,
forty years before, when, a boy of fifteen, he had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
declared of age by his grandfather, the Emperor
Maximilian, and glanced briefly at the long record
of wars and journeys, and the other chief events of his
reign. Finally he commended his successor to them,
asking them to serve his son as well as they had served
him, and begging his loyal subjects to pardon him
for any injustice which he might unwittingly have
done them. Tears rolled down the great Emperor's
cheeks as he spoke these last words, and Sir Thomas
Gresham, who was present, says that there was not
a dry eye in the whole assembly.</p>

<p>Christina was present on this memorable occasion.
In contemporary prints she is represented standing
by the side of the Regent's chair, listening with
breathless attention to every word that fell from her
uncle's lips. She saw the pathetic scene between
the father and son, when Charles, raising Philip from
his knees and clasping him in his arms, gave him
the investiture of the Provinces, and, turning to the
deputies, in a broken voice asked them to excuse
his tears, which flowed for love of them. And she
listened with still greater emotion to the touching
words in which Mary begged the Emperor and the
States to forgive whatever mistakes she had made
out of ignorance or incapacity, and thanked them
from the depth of her heart for their unfailing love
and loyalty. Her speech produced a fresh burst of
tears, after which Charles thanked his sister for her
long and faithful services, and Maes, the Pensionary
of Antwerp, bore eloquent testimony to the undying
love and gratitude which the States felt for the Queen
who had governed them so well.</p>

<p>There were still many formalities to be gone
through, many farewells to be said, before Charles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
could lay down the sovereign power. On the day
after his abdication, the Archduke Ferdinand, his
favourite nephew, arrived with affectionate messages
from his father, who found it impossible to leave
Vienna as long as the war with the Turks lasted.
The next day he went hunting with the King, Mary,
and Christina, and dined with them and Eleanor.
On the 3rd of November he left Brussels again after
all too short a visit, as Charles wrote to his brother.</p>

<p>Another guest who took leave of the Emperor in
the same week was Edward Courtenay, Lord Devonshire.
This young nobleman of the blood royal had
been exiled from England lest he should marry
Elizabeth, and had been so often seen in the palace
during the last few months that rumour said he was
going to wed Madame of Lorraine. Now he came
to thank her for the "gentle entertainment" which
she had shown him, and bid her a reluctant farewell
before he left for Italy. In the following spring another
old friend, Adolf of Holstein, came to Brussels and
took leave of the Emperor. The Danish Prince,
hearing that all idea of the Savoy marriage was
abandoned, took this opportunity to make a last
attempt to win Christina's hand. But not even the
Duke's constancy could induce her to change her
mind, and he went away disconsolate.<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1556</span>] DEATH OF THE PALATINE</div>

<p>A fresh sorrow awaited her in the death of her
brother-in-law, the Elector Palatine, who breathed his
last at Alzei, in the Lower Palatinate, on the 26th of
February, 1556. The fine old man was in his seventy-third
year, and had been tenderly nursed all through
a long illness by his wife. Three weeks before his
death Dorothea sent for his nephew and successor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span>Otto Heinrich, who remained with him to the end,
and brought his body to Heidelberg. Here he lay
in state for three days in the Court chapel, after
which his remains were borne down the castle slopes
by eight noblemen, and laid with his forefathers in
the church of the Holy Ghost. By order of the new
Elector, he was buried with Lutheran rites. Dorothea
and Countess Helene followed on foot with a long
train of nobles and students of the University, bearing
lighted tapers, and German hymns were sung by the
Canons and school-children.<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p>

<p>Christina's first impulse was to hasten to her
widowed sister, but neither the Emperor nor his
sisters would allow her to leave the Netherlands
before their departure, saying that she was as dear
and indispensable to them as a daughter.<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> She was
present at the Casino in the park on the 16th of
January, when Charles resigned the kingdoms of
Spain and Sicily and his dominions in the New World
to Philip, and she accompanied Mary to Antwerp
when Philip held his first Chapter of the Fleece.
Among the new Knights elected at this meeting were
William of Orange, Philip, Duke of Aerschot, and
Christina's old friend Jean De Montmorency, Sieur de
Courri&egrave;res, whose whole life had been spent in the
Emperor's service, and who had deserved well of
Philip by helping to arrange his marriage with Mary
Tudor.<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<p>On the 5th of February, 1556, the long-protracted
peace negotiations were brought to a happy conclusion,
and a five years' truce was signed at the Abbey of Vaucelles,
near Cambray, by Lalaing on Philip's part and by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>Coligny on that of Henry. Both parties were to retain
their conquests, and the chief prisoners on both sides
were to be released. On Lady Day the French Admiral
brought the treaty to be confirmed by the King at
Brussels, and was received by Philip in the palace.
By an unlucky chance, the great hall in which the
reception took place was hung with tapestries representing
the defeat of Pavia and surrender of Francis I.
This wounded the vanity of the French lords, and the
King's jester, Brusquet, who had accompanied
Coligny, determined to have his revenge on the
haughty Spanish Prince. So the next morning at
Mass in the Court church, when Philip was in the
act of taking his oath on the Gospels to keep the truce,
Brusquet suddenly raised a cry of "Largesse!" and,
taking a handful of French crowns from a sack which
his valet carried, flung them to the crowds who had
collected in the great hall adjoining the chapel. The
King looked round in surprise at Coligny, who
stood dumbfounded, while men, women, and children,
rushed to pick up the coins on the floor, and had to
be warned off by the archers' pikes. The King was
about to ask angrily by what right the French did
largesse in his palace, when both Queen Mary and
Madame de Lorraine burst into uncontrollable fits of
laughter, in which Philip joined so heartily that he
had to cling to the altar to save himself from falling.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1556</span>] LAST FESTIVITIES</div>

<p>This absurd incident was related to Charles when,
on the following Sunday of <i>P&acirc;ques-fleuries</i>, Coligny
went to visit him in the Casino. "Well, Brusquet,"
he said to the jester, "how are you? I hear you have
been doing me fine largesse with your crowns."
"Sire," replied Brusquet, dropping on one knee,
"you take the words out of my mouth in condescend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>ing
to notice a worm like myself." And the poor fool
went home to boast of his interview with the great
Emperor to the end of his life.<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a></p>

<p>A grand tournament was held in the park at Brussels
to celebrate the conclusion of the truce, and Egmont
distinguished himself above all competitors by his
prowess. But a quarrel arose between Philip and
his aunt, Mary of Hungary, who complained of the
disrespect with which her nephew and his Spanish
courtiers treated her, saying that, although she had
laid down the Regency, she expected to be treated
with the honour due to a Queen. She retired to her
own domain at Turnhout, but had her revenge a
few weeks later, for the States proved so unwilling to
grant the aids demanded by the King that Philip was
forced to send Arras to beg for his aunt's help. Mary
consented to return as soon as she had despatched
her most urgent private affairs, and so invaluable
was her influence with the Council, that Philip joined
his father in entreating her to remain at Brussels
during his absence in England. This, however, Mary
quite refused to do, saying that the Duke of Savoy
would no doubt prove an excellent substitute.<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a></p>

<p>The King and Queen of Bohemia, whom Charles
was very anxious to see before his departure,
and whose journey had been repeatedly delayed, at
length reached Brussels on the 18th of July. Their
presence was the signal for a last series of festivities.
There were jousts on the Grande Place, banquets in
the h&ocirc;tel-de-ville, hunting-parties at Groenendal in the
forest of Soignies, and suppers at the Villa Laura,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>where Mary entertained her nephews and nieces at
an open-air concert. King Max was in high spirits.
He made great friends with the Venetian Badoer, and
frankly avowed his dislike of the Spaniards, saying,
with a ringing laugh, that he was glad to hear the
English had taught them a lesson or two. The visit
was not without its political intention, and Maximilian
succeeded in persuading his uncle to consent to
Ferdinand's entreaty, and retain the imperial title
for the present, in order to avoid any dispute on the
question of the succession.<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a></p>

<p>When his daughter and her husband left Brussels,
on the 8th of August, Charles felt himself a free man.
At half-past four in the afternoon he set out for
Ghent, after receiving the farewells of the chief
nobles and Bishops. Many were in tears, but the
Emperor remained calm and serene until he rode
out of the gates, escorted for the last time by his
faithful archers. Then, turning round, he took a last
long look at the city towers and wept bitterly. "Everyone
about him was in tears," says Badoer, "and
many wept when he was gone."<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> Christina accompanied
her aunts to Ghent a few days later, and went
on at the end of the month with the Queens and
Emperor to Zeeland, to wait for a fair wind. On the
15th of October Charles embarked at Flushing, and
his sisters followed on another ship. Two days
later an easterly breeze sprang up and the fleet set
sail. Christina stood on the shore till the ship which
bore the great Emperor from his native land dropped
below the horizon. Then she retraced her steps
sorrowfully to join her children at Ghent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1556</span>] FRUSTRATED WISHES</div>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>When her uncle and aunts were gone, Christina
felt that there was nothing more to keep her at
Brussels. She had already thought of retiring to her
dower city of Tortona, but the castle was occupied
by a Spanish garrison, and while the war lasted the
Lombard city was hardly a safe place. This being
the case, she asked Philip's leave to take up her
residence at Vigevano, the summer palace of the
Sforzas, which the Duke had bequeathed to her,
but was told that this house was required for the
Viceroy's use. After the Palatine's death she was
seized with a longing to join Dorothea, and proposed
to go to Heidelberg, and then on to Lorraine, in the
hope that, now peace was signed, the French King
would allow her son to enjoy his own again. But
there were more difficulties in the way than she had
anticipated.<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a></p>

<p>Simon Renard and the other delegates to the conference
at Vaucelles were especially charged to
include the Duke of Lorraine's restoration among
their demands; but the French, while professing the
utmost friendship for both the Duchess and her son,
pointed out that her guardianship would expire in
another year, and that the Regent Vaudemont and
the Guises, who were the Duke's nearest kinsmen,
agreed to his residence at the French Court. In vain
Renard and Lalaing protested at the strange kindness
shown to the Duchess in detaining her son. This
only led to a long wrangle, which almost caused the
rupture of peace negotiations, and eventually no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
mention was made of Lorraine in the articles of the
truce.</p>

<p>In May Christina's alarm was aroused by an intimation
from the French Court that the King was
going to Nancy to celebrate his daughter Claude's
wedding with the Duke, and occupy the capital of
Lorraine. Fortunately, Vaudemont opposed this
measure, saying that as Regent he had sworn never
to give up his post until his nephew was of age, and
begged the King to allow Charles to return to Nancy
and take possession of his State before his marriage.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a>
This unexpected firmness on Vaudemont's part produced
the desired effect. Henry's journey to Lorraine
was put off for a year, and at the Duchess's urgent
request the Cardinal of Lorraine obtained the King's
leave to bring the boy to meet her at the Castle of
Coucy, near his own house at P&eacute;ronne. But when
Philip was asked to give the Duchess permission to
cross the frontier, he made so many irksome conditions,
that Henry withdrew his promise, and the
long-desired meeting was again deferred. Christina
was cruelly disappointed, and could only take comfort
from Vaudemont's assurances that before long her
son would be free from control and able to decide for
himself.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1556</span>] MARY'S JEALOUSY</div>

<p>Philip on his part was extremely anxious to keep
the Duchess at Brussels. As Brant&ocirc;me tells us, the
King not only cherished great affection for his
cousin, but relied implicitly on her tact and wisdom,
and, in compliance with his entreaties, she consented
to remain at the palace and do the honours of his
Court.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Her popularity with the nobles made her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>presence the more desirable, while the King himself
found her company far more to his taste than that
of the faded and fretful wife who awaited him in
England. Every post brought bitter reproaches and
passionate prayers from the unhappy Queen, whose
hopes of her lord's return were doomed to perpetual
disappointment. Already more than a year had
passed since he had left England, and there still seemed
no prospect of his return. First the peace conferences,
then the King of Bohemia's visit and the
Emperor's departure, were pleaded as excuses for
these prolonged delays. When the fleet that bore
the Emperor to Spain was seen off Dover, the
Admiral who visited His Majesty on board, brought
back messages to say that the King would shortly
cross the Channel. On hearing this, Mary's spirits
rose, and it was only by Philip's express desire that
she refrained from going to meet him at Dover. In
October the royal stables and equerries arrived, but
Philip himself wrote that the war which had broken
out in Italy between Alva, the Viceroy of Naples, and
Pope Paul IV., compelled him to return to Brussels.
Then Mary broke into a passion of rage mingled with
sobs and tears, and shut herself up in her room, refusing
to see any visitors. The dulness of the Court
had become intolerable; there were no f&ecirc;tes and few
audiences, and the Ambassadors with one accord
begged to be recalled. The Queen's ill-temper vented
itself on all who approached her presence, and even
in public she occasionally gave way to paroxysms
of fury.<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a> Suspicions of her husband's fidelity to his
marriage vows now came to increase her misery.
When she heard of Philip going on long hunting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>-parties
with the Duchess of Lorraine, and dancing
with her at masques, she was seized with transports
of rage, and, rushing at the portrait of her husband
which hung over her bed, was with difficulty restrained
from cutting it to pieces.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1556</span>] THE DUCHESS OF PARMA</div>

<p>Meanwhile a rival to Christina appeared at Court
in the person of the King's half-sister Margaret,
Duchess of Parma. This Princess, the illegitimate
daughter of Charles V. and Margaret Van Gheynst,
a beautiful maiden in the Countess Lalaing's service,
was born at Oudenarde in 1522, and brought up under
the eye of the Archduchess Margaret. At thirteen
she was married to Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of
Florence, with whom she led a miserable life until
this worthless Prince was murdered by his cousin in
1537. Her second union, with Ottavio Farnese,
Pope Paul III.'s grandson, proved little happier.
Ottavio was an intractable boy of thirteen when he
married her in November, 1538, and the quarrels of
the young couple fill pages of the Emperor's correspondence
in the archives of Simancas. After the
Duke's return from the expedition to Algiers, a
reconciliation was effected, and Margaret bore a son,
who became the famous captain Alexander of Parma.
But the Farnese were always a thorn in the Emperor's
side, and, by joining with his foes at a critical moment,
involved him in the gravest disaster of his life. Now
harmony was restored in the family circle, and when
the war with Paul IV. broke out, Philip secured
Ottavio's alliance by giving him the citadel of
Piacenza. Margaret and her young son came to the
Netherlands to pay their respects to the King and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>thank him for this mark of his favour. They arrived
at Christmas, in the depths of the severest winter
that had been known for many years. The Scheldt
was frozen over at Antwerp, and the Court was busy
with winter sports, in which Philip and Christina
took an active part, playing games and sleighing in
the park, and attending a masked ball given by Count
Lalaing on the ice.<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a></p>

<p>The Duchess of Parma was received with due
honour at Court, and was cordially welcomed by
Christina, who had known her as a child. A handsome
woman of thirty-five, she resembled her Flemish
mother more than her imperial father, and bore few
traces of her Habsburg origin. She had none of
Christina's distinction and refinement, while her
manners were too haughty to please the Flemish
nobles. But she had a keen eye to her own interests,
and the atmosphere of deception and intrigue in
which her married life had been spent had taught
her to adapt herself to circumstances. She contrived
to make herself agreeable both to Philip and Christina,
with whom most of her time was spent. The
new Venetian Ambassador, Soranzo, paid his respects
to the two ladies on his arrival, and found both of
them very friendly and pleasant. The Duchess of
Lorraine, as Badoer had frequently remarked, was
always particularly cordial to the Venetian Signory,
to whom her first husband, the Duke of Milan, owed
so much. At the same time the Queen of England,
anxious to show civility to her husband's family,
sent Sir Richard Shelley to give the Duchess of
Parma a sisterly welcome, and invite her to come to
London.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span></p>

<p>In the midst of the Christmas festivities, news
reached Brussels of a treacherous attempt of the
French, under Coligny, to surprise Douay. Fortunately
the plot was discovered in time; but the truce
was broken, and every day fresh incursions were made
by the French, which naturally produced reprisals.
The rupture was complete, and, in his anxiety to
secure the help of England in the coming struggle,
the King at length crossed the Channel, and joined
Mary at Greenwich on the 21st of January, 1557.
Political exigencies had done more to hasten his
return than all his wife's prayers and tears, but in
her joy she recked little of this, and guns were fired
and <i>Te Deums</i> chanted throughout the realm.
Before leaving Brussels, Philip had made arrangements
for the two Duchesses to follow him in a
few days. Their society, he felt, would help to
dispel the gloom of Mary's Court, and Margaret's
coming would allay any jealousy which Christina's
visit might excite. Another and more important
motive for his cousin's presence in England at this
moment was his anxiety to revive the old scheme of
a marriage between the Princess Elizabeth and the
Duke of Savoy. Mary's state of health made her
sister's marriage a matter of the highest importance,
and the new quarrel with France had put an end
to the Duke's hopes in that quarter. As both
the French and Venetian Ambassadors constantly
affirmed, Emanuel Philibert was the only foreign
Prince whom the English would tolerate, and Christina
herself told Vaudemont that she was going to
England, by the King's wish, to bring back Madame
Elizabeth as the Duke of Savoy's bride.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1557</span>] CHRISTINA AT WHITEHALL</div>

<p>The King had a calm passage to Dover, but the
ladies were less fortunate, for an equinoctial gale
sprang up when they were halfway across the
Channel.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duchesses," wrote Philip's secretary, Jean de
Courteville, "had to dance without music between
Dover and Calais, and the results were such as are
commonly the case with travellers unaccustomed to
the sea. The great festivities we are having here this
Lent will grieve them the less."<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a></p></div>

<p>But if the passage was disagreeable, nothing was
lacking in the kindness of their reception. The Queen
sent her litter to meet them at Dover, with chariot
and hackney horses for their suite, and at Gravesend,
Lady Lennox and Lady Kildare were waiting to
conduct them in the royal barge to Whitehall. Here
Philip received them at the water-gate, and led them
up the steps into the great hall, where Mary welcomed
her guests. The King and Queen who had
only arrived from Greenwich the day before rode
in state through the city, with the Lord Mayor
carrying the sceptre at the head of the guilds and
crafts of London, while a salute was fired from the
Tower and bells rang from all the churches.</p>

<p>Both the Duchesses were lodged in the Palace of
Westminster, Christina in rooms on the ground-floor,
looking on the gardens, and Margaret in an apartment
on the upper floor, commanding a view of the
Thames.<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> Soon after their arrival another visitor
was brought by the Bishop of London to see Their
Majesties&mdash;an Envoy from the Czar of Muscovy,
who was lodged in Fenchurch Street, as the guest of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>the Company of Muscovite Merchants. Englishmen
and Spaniards, Lorrainers and Italians, alike looked
with curious eyes at this stranger from the shores of
the Polar Sea, who was clad in robes of Oriental
splendour, and whose turban glittered with gems.
He brought the Queen a present of magnificent sables
from the Czar, and saluted her by bowing his whole
body down and touching the ground with his hand.
In spite of his strange clothes and barbarous language,
he was a cultivated person, as keen to see the sights
of London as Christina herself. One day he dined
with the Lord Mayor in gorgeous attire, another he
attended Mass at Westminster and saw St. Edward's
shrine, with the relics which had been fortunately
preserved when the Abbey was plundered.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1557</span>] ST. GEORGE'S FEAST</div>

<p>After spending a fortnight at Whitehall, Philip
and Mary took their guests to spend Easter at
Greenwich. On Maundy Thursday the King and
Queen washed the feet of a number of poor beggars,
and blessed the cramp rings, which were as much
prized in Spain and Flanders as in England. Easter
Day witnessed fresh balls and banquets, dog and
bear fights, bull-baiting and horse-races, after which
a large hunting-party was given in the park for the
Duchess of Lorraine's amusement. On the 22nd of
April the royal party returned to Whitehall for St.
George's Feast. High Mass was celebrated in the
Abbey by the Bishop of Winchester, and all the
Knights of the Garter, in their mantles of royal blue,
walked in procession round the inner court of the
palace, while the Queen and her guests looked on from
a window on the garden side. The King and Queen
and all the Knights of the Order attended vespers in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>the Abbey, after which the Muscovite Envoy came
to take leave of Their Majesties, and delivered a long
farewell speech, which was translated by an interpreter
into English and Spanish, expressing his hope
that these mighty Sovereigns might live to see their
children's children. Six English ships were in readiness
to escort the stranger across the Northern seas,
and prevent him falling into the hands of the Norsemen,
who were jealous of English interference with
the trade of Muscovy.</p>

<p>On Sunday the Queen gave a grand banquet, and
appeared resplendent in cloth of gold and jewels.
Christina sat on her right, and Margaret, with her
little son, on the King's left hand. The next morning
the Duchess of Parma left for Italy, but Christina,
at Philip's entreaty, remained in London another
ten days. She was already very popular with the
English, and made friends with Lord Arundel, Lord
Pembroke, and several other nobles and ladies at
Court, while her splendid robes and jewels, her
numerous suite and fine horses, excited general
admiration. In the midst of the Court f&ecirc;tes, she
found time to visit several shrines and places of
interest, and, while the King was holding the Chapter
of the Garter on St. George's Day, went by water to
the Tower, and was shown its treasures and antiquities.
But in one respect her visit proved a failure. Mary
refused to entertain any idea of the Savoy marriage,
and would not even allow Christina a glimpse of
Princess Elizabeth, who was kept at Hatfield in
strict seclusion during her visit. What was worse,
the Duchess's presence revived all the Queen's
jealousy, and, in spite of the King's protests, Christina
found it prudent to hasten her departure. All manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
of stories about Mary's dislike of the Duchess found
their way to the French Court, and King Henry had
many jokes with Soranzo on the subject, and told
him he heard that the Queen flew into a frantic
passion when the King led out his cousin to dance
at Greenwich.<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a></p>

<p>Philip did his best to atone for his wife's ill-humour,
and, when Christina expressed a wish to visit Ghent
on her return, wrote to ask the Duke of Savoy to see
that she and her daughters were well lodged and
entertained in the old Prinzenhof. On the 11th of
May the Duchess wrote a formal letter of thanks to
the Queen from Dover, acknowledging the attentions
which she had received from Her Majesty and all
her subjects, and on the 8th of June she sent her a
second letter from Ghent, on behalf of the widow
and daughter of Sir Jacques de Granado, a Brabant
gentleman who had been Equerry to Henry VIII.
and Edward VI., and had met his death by accident
during the Duchess's visit. As he rode into the
privy garden at Whitehall before the Queen's
chariot, his bridle broke, the horse shied violently,
and dashed his rider's head against the wall. Sir
Jacques was killed on the spot, and buried at St.
Dunstan's in the East two days afterwards with a
great display of torches and escutcheons. On Christina's
recommendation, the Queen granted a pension
of &pound;50 to the widow, and saw that she and her children
were amply provided for.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1557</span>] THE VICTORY OF ST. QUENTIN</div>

<p>From Ghent the Duchess went to meet her sister
Dorothea at J&uuml;lich, the Court of the Duke of Cleves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>and the Archduchess Maria. The reformed faith
was now firmly established in the Palatinate, and
Dorothea's well-known Lutheran leanings were a
great source of annoyance to her own family. "The
Electress Dorothea," wrote Badoer from Brussels
in 1557, "is known to be a Lutheran and against
the Emperor, and is as much hated here as her sister
Christina is beloved." From his retreat at St. Yuste,
Charles begged Philip to invite Dorothea to settle at
Brussels, "lest one of our own blood should openly
forsake the faith." When the Princess declined this
proposal, Philip and Arras desired Christina to use
her influence to bring her sister to a better mind.
But Dorothea resisted all these attempts obstinately,
and went back to Neuburg to live among her
husband's kindred and worship God in her own way.<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>On the 1st of June England declared war against
France, and Philip returned to Brussels, having
accomplished the object of his journey. Here he
was joined by the Duchess of Lorraine and the Count
of Vaudemont, who came to Flanders to try and
reopen peace negotiations. But the moment, as
Arras told him, was singularly inopportune, since
Philip was armed to the teeth and had England at
his back. On the 11th of August the King left
Brussels for the camp before St. Quentin, where he
arrived just too late to claim a share in the brilliant
victory gained by the Duke of Savoy and Egmont
over the French on St. Lawrence's Day. The
Constable Montmorency, the Marshal St. Andr&eacute;,
Admiral Coligny, and the Rhinegrave, were among
the prisoners made on this memorable day, together
with all the guns and fifty-six colours. The news<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
of this decisive victory was celebrated with great
joy both in Brussels and across the Channel. <i>Te
Deum</i> was sung in St. Paul's, and the loyal citizens
of London lighted bonfires and sat up drinking
through the livelong night; while in Paris the King
and Queen went to Notre Dame in sackcloth, and
Henry II. carried the Crown of Thorns in procession
from the Sainte Chapelle. In the lonely monastery
far away on the heights of Estremadura, the news
sent a thrill to the great Emperor's heart, and he
asked eagerly in what route his son was marching
on Paris. Had Philip followed this course, had he,
in Suriano's words, "taken Fortune at the flood,"
he might have brought the campaign to a triumphant
close. But, with characteristic timidity, he confined
himself to capturing St. Quentin, and then returned
to Brussels, throwing away such an opportunity as
comes but once a lifetime.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>

<h2>BOOK XII<br />

THE PEACE OF C&Acirc;TEAU-CAMBR&Eacute;SIS<br />

1557-1559</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The lull that followed the decisive battle of St.
Quentin afforded the Duchess of Lorraine a favourable
opportunity for resuming her efforts to open
negotiations between the contending monarchs. The
Constable, after fighting like a lion and receiving a
severe wound, had been made prisoner, and was
taken to the Castle of Ghent, where Christina and
her daughters were staying. The Duchess paid him
daily visits, and brought him letters of condolence
from her aunt Eleanor, who wrote that she wished
she were still in Flanders to nurse her old friend.
More than this: Christina obtained leave for his wife
to visit him, and even proposed that the prisoner
should be allowed to go to France on parole. These
good offices gratified the French King, who was very
anxious for his favourite's release, and whose behaviour
towards the Duchess now underwent a marked
change.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p>

<p>The young Duke Charles was almost fifteen, and
his marriage to the Princess Claude was fixed for the
following spring. With the King's leave, he sent his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
steward to Ghent to invite his mother to the wedding,
and at the same time make proposals of peace through
Montmorency. These letters were laid before Philip
by Christina, and a brisk correspondence was carried
on between her and the Constable. In December
Vaudemont came to Brussels, bringing portraits of
Charles and his bride as a gift from Henry II. to the
Duchess, and negotiations were actively pursued.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a>
But just when the wished-for goal at length seemed
to be in sight, and Christina was rejoicing to think
of once more seeing her son, all her hopes were
shattered by the Duke of Guise's capture of Calais.
The surprise had been cleverly planned and brilliantly
executed. The new fortifications of the town were
unfinished, and after a gallant resistance the little
garrison was overpowered and forced to capitulate,
on the 8th of January, 1558. This unexpected success
revived the courage of the French, and strengthened
the Guise brothers in the determined opposition
which they offered to peace. The star of their house
was at its zenith, and on the 24th of April the
marriage of their niece, the young Queen of Scots, to
the Dauphin, was celebrated with great splendour
at Paris. In deference to his mother's wishes, the
Duke of Lorraine's wedding was put off till the
following year, when he should have attained his
majority; but he figured conspicuously in the day's
pageant, and led his lovely cousin in her lily-white
robes and jewelled crown up the nave of Notre
Dame.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1558</span>] CHRISTINA MEETS HER SON</div>

<p>The French King now gave his consent to Vaudemont's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>request, that a meeting should be arranged
between the Duke and his mother in the neighbourhood
of P&eacute;ronne. Philip, after his wont, raised many
difficulties, and insisted that the Bishop of Arras
must be present at the interview.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> At length all
preliminaries were arranged, and on the 1st of May
Charles left Paris with his uncle Vaudemont and
Guise's eldest son, Henri, Prince of Joinville, attended
by an escort of 200 horse. The Duchess had already
arrived at Cambray with her daughters and Anne
of Aerschot, accompanied by Egmont, Arras, and
a great train of courtiers, and had prepared a splendid
reception for her son. But at the last moment fresh
difficulties arose. The Cardinal of Lorraine sent
Robertet, the King's secretary, to tell the Duchess
that, although her son was most anxious to see her,
it would be derogatory to his master's dignity for
him to enter King Philip's territories as a suppliant
for peace. Would Her Highness therefore consent
to come as far as his castle at P&eacute;ronne? This Philip
quite refused to allow, and eventually the village of
Marcoing, halfway between Cambray and P&eacute;ronne,
was fixed upon as the meeting-place. An old manor-house
which had been partly destroyed in the late
military operations was hastily repaired for the
occasion, and here, on the 15th of May, the much-desired
meeting at length took place.<a name="FNanchor_533" id="FNanchor_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> The Frenchmen,
who came in riding-clothes, were amazed to find
the splendid company awaiting them. The Duchess
with the young Princesses, Anne of Aerschot, and the
Princess of Macedonia, stood under a bower of leafy
boughs, and Egmont and the other courtiers were
all richly clad and mounted on fine horses. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>coming of the guests was greeted by a gay fanfare
of trumpets and roll of drums, together with salutes
of artillery. Then the young Duke, springing from
his horse, rushed into his mother's arms. At the
sight of her boy, Christina burst into tears and almost
fainted away. For some minutes she remained
unable to speak, and the spectators were deeply
moved by her emotion. After repeatedly embracing
his mother, Charles kissed his sisters and aunt, and
proceeded to salute Egmont and the rest of the company
with charming grace; while the happy mother
followed his movements with delight, and could not
take her eyes off the tall and handsome youth whom
she had last seen as a child, and who had grown up
the image of his father.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1558</span>] DUKE CHARLES OF LORRAINE</div>

<p>During the conversation which followed, Charles
spoke to his mother with great good sense and wisdom,
telling her how kindly he was treated at the French
Court, and how it would be hard for him to feel at
home anywhere else. But directly after his marriage
he and his wife intended to return to Nancy, where he
hoped that his mother would join them and live among
their own people. The Duchess and her children now
sat down to an exquisite <i>d&eacute;jeuner</i> with the Duchess
of Aerschot and the Cardinal, while Egmont and Arras
entertained Vaudemont and the Prince of Joinville,
and the other French gentlemen dined with the
members of Christina's suite. After dinner three
Spanish jennets which King Philip had sent the
young Duke were led out, and Charles mounted a
spirited charger given him by the French monarch,
and performed a variety of feats of horsemanship
before the company, to his mother's great delight.
Then the Duchess and her sister and children retired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
to enjoy each other's company in private, leaving
the Cardinal to confer with Arras and Egmont.</p>

<p>The Cardinal produced the royal mandate, and
Robertet read out Henry's proposals, offering to
restore Savoy to the Duke, but only on condition
of receiving Milan in exchange. All Arras would
say in reply to these demands was that they must
be referred to his master, upon which the Cardinal
exclaimed with some heat that these were the
only terms which the King of France would accept.
"Thus," remarks the Venetian Ambassador, "this
meeting, which began with such a beautiful outburst
of motherly love and tenderness, ended in mutual recrimination."<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>
The Cardinal then took leave of the
company, after presenting the young Princesses and
their mother with gifts of gold bracelets, rings, and
brooches, and receiving a box of choice gloves, perfumed,
and embroidered in Italian fashion from the
Duchess. As he rode back to P&eacute;ronne, he saw the
flames of a burning village which had been destroyed
by the Imperialists, and, in spite of his safe-conduct,
was seized with so great a panic that he hurried back
to Paris, fearing his ch&acirc;teau might be surprised
by the foes. The young Duke and Vaudemont
spent another day with the Duchess, and only returned
to Compi&egrave;gne on the 18th of May. Here
Charles received the warmest of welcomes from the
royal family, who had feared that he might be induced
to remain with his mother. The King threw his
arms round the boy's neck, the Queen and Dauphin,
the Princesses Elizabeth and Claude and the young
Queen of Scots, all embraced him affectionately,
telling him how much they had missed him. In fact,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>as Soranzo remarks, this short absence served to show
how much beloved the young Prince was by the
whole Court.<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Arras and Egmont returned to Brussels,
satisfied that the French had no real wish for peace,
and Philip declared his conviction that they had
made a plot to capture the Duchess, which had only
been defeated by the strong escort with which she
was attended. But Christina herself was radiant
with happiness, and received congratulations from
all her friends. The French had done her many
cruel wrongs, but they had not been able to rob her
of her son's heart, and the future still held the
promise of some golden hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1558</span>] THE PRINCE OF ORANGE</div>

<p>For a while the war still raged fiercely. The
capture of Thionville by Guise in June was followed
a month later by Egmont's fresh victory at Gravelines,
when the Governor of Calais, De Thermes, and
his whole force, were cut to pieces. The Count had
always been a splendid and popular figure; now he
was the idol of the whole nation. His brilliant feat
of arms had saved Flanders from utter ruin, and
made peace once more possible. Both sides were
thoroughly weary of the long struggle, the resources
of both countries were exhausted, and the unhappy
inhabitants of Picardy and Artois were crying out
for a respite from their sufferings. Christina made
use of the opportunity to renew her correspondence
with the Constable and the Marshal St. Andr&eacute;, his
companion in captivity.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> A new recruit now came
to her help in the person of William of Orange. This
young Prince had enjoyed the favour of Charles V.
and his sister Mary from his boyhood, and had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>treated with especial kindness by the Duchess of
Aerschot and her sister-in-law. The death of his
young wife, Anna, Countess B&uuml;ren, in the spring of
1558, had thrown him much into the company of
these ladies, and it was already whispered at Court
that he would certainly marry Madame de Lorraine's
elder daughter, Ren&eacute;e, who was growing up a tall and
attractive maiden. The Prince himself was a handsome
youth with fine brown eyes and curly auburn
locks, and a charm of manner which few could resist.
If the cares and anxieties of his later life made him
taciturn, in youth he was the most genial and
pleasant of companions, and Arras, who never loved
him, said that he "made a friend every time that
he lifted his hat." His attire was always as faultless
as it was splendid, he was renowned for his skill as
a rider and jouster, and had greatly distinguished
himself in the recent campaigns. Both in his home
at Breda and in the stately Nassau house at Brussels
the Prince kept open house, and the worst faults of
which his enemies could accuse him were his reckless
hospitality and extravagant tastes.</p>

<p>Christina had always taken especial interest in
William of Orange, for the sake of the kinsman whose
name and wealth he inherited, and he on his part
became deeply attached to her. So intimate was
their friendship, that the Duchess one day told
Count Feria's English wife, Jane Dormer, in speaking
of the Prince's intended marriage with her
daughter, that she would gladly have married him
herself.<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a></p>

<p>The Prince now joined his personal exertions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
those of the Duchess, and was the frequent bearer of
letters between Brussels and the camp near Amiens,
where the two Kings and their rival armies were
drawn up face to face. At length, on the 9th of
September, a ten days' armistice was proclaimed,
and a few days later the Prince of Orange, Ruy
Gomez, and Arras, met the Constable and St.
Andr&eacute; at Lille, to discuss preliminaries of peace.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a>
The two French prisoners were eager for peace, and
had the secret support of Henry II. and Diane
de Poitiers; but the Guises, who had everything to
lose and nothing to gain by the cessation of war,
were still strongly opposed to a truce, and Renard
told Philip that the only way of gaining their good-will
would be to give Mademoiselle de Lorraine's
hand to the Prince of Joinville. In the end, however,
their opposition was overruled, and on the 30th
of September William of Orange was able to bring the
Duchess news that a Conference had been arranged,
and would take place at the Abbey of Cercamp, near
Cambray, in October. He found Christina at Douai,
where she and her daughters were attending a marriage
in the d'Aremberg family. She had just heard of her
son's return to Nancy, where he had been received
with acclamation by his subjects, and where her
own presence was eagerly expected. But at Philip's
earnest entreaty she consented to remain in Flanders
for the present, and preside at the coming Conference.
This proposal was strongly supported by the Cardinal
of Lorraine, who hastened to send the Duchess a
safe-conduct, saying that her presence would do
more than anything to bring the desired peace to
perfection.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a></p>

<p>Christina herself was very reluctant to accept the
post, as we learn from the following letter which she
wrote to Philip from Douai on the 12th of October.
Her delicate child, Dorothea, was ailing, and her
faithful companion, the aged Princess of Macedonia,
was hardly fit to be left alone.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I have received the letter which Your Majesty
has been pleased to send me, and thank you humbly
for your affectionate expressions. As to the inconvenience
of the place selected for this Conference,
I should never allow my comfort or pleasure to interfere
with your commands, and will accordingly go
to Arras to-morrow and await your further orders.
I have been very unwell lately, and must beg Your
Majesty to provide for my safety, not only because
I am a woman, but because, as you know, I am not
in the good graces of the French. My daughters
must remain here a few days longer, as Dorothea is
indisposed, and the Princess of Macedonia is in a
very feeble state. I will follow Your Majesty's
advice as to Bassompierre's mission and my son's
affairs, and cannot thank you enough for your kind
thought of me and my children. I kiss Your Majesty's
hands.</p></div>

</p>

<p>Some further difficulties&mdash;chiefly the work of
Silliers, poor Belloni's hated rival and successor&mdash;delayed
the Duchess's journey for another week.
On the 16th Arras wrote to tell her that the Commissioners
had already arrived at Cercamp, and beg
her to come as soon as possible. The Cardinal was
very anxious to see her, and hoped that she would
not fail to bring his young cousins, "Mesdames your
daughters," with her. Christina could delay no
longer, and hastened to Cercamp the following day.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<h3>II.</h3>

<p>On the 17th of October, 1558, a fortnight's truce
was proclaimed. Both armies remained encamped
on their own territories, while the two Kings withdrew
respectively to Arras and Beauvais. The next
day the Commissioners met at one o'clock in the
Duchess's lodgings. The Prince of Orange, Alva,
Ruy Gomez, Arras, and Viglius, the President of
the Council, represented Philip; while the Constable,
the Cardinal of Lorraine, St. Andr&eacute;, the Bishop of
Orleans, and Secretary l'Aubespine, were the five
French deputies. Stroppiana represented the Duke
of Savoy, and the English deputies, Lord Arundel,
Dr. Wotton, and Thirlby, Bishop of Ely, arrived a few
days later. The Duchess welcomed the Commissioners
in a brief speech, explaining that, as for
several years past she had endeavoured to make
peace between these two illustrious monarchs, it was
their pleasure that she should continue her good
offices, adding that she would count herself too happy
if her services could help to attain this blessed end,
and relieve the people of both countries from the
awful miseries of war.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1558</span>] PEACE NEGOTIATIONS</div>

<p>During the next fortnight conferences were held
daily in the presence of Christina, who herself read
aloud each different proposal that was made, and
showed infinite tact in smoothing over difficulties and
suggesting points of agreement. Each morning the
deputies met at Mass in the parish church, and often
discussed separate questions after service. In the
evenings, private interviews took place in Christina's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>rooms, and the Prince of Orange held long conversations
with Montmorency and the Cardinal, which
contributed not a little to their mutual understanding.
"Loving entertainments," in Suriano's phrase, "were
exchanged," and one night the Duchess gave a
banquet in honour of the Constable's wife and
daughter, who paid a visit to Cercamp. As the
Cardinal complained jestingly, Montmorency was too
good a Christian and all too ready to make peace
with his country's enemies. But King Henry supported
him secretly, and sent private notes and
messages, telling him to take no notice of the Guises,
and do all he could to make peace.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

<p>The great difficulty which had hitherto stood in the
way of all attempts at negotiation was the restitution
of Savoy. The Constable now proposed that the
Duke should marry the King's sister, Madame
Marguerite, with a dower of 300,000 crowns, and
be placed in possession of the chief portion of his
dominions. At first the Duke demurred to this offer,
and begged that the King's daughter Claude should
be substituted for her aunt, who was five years his
senior. But the Cardinal replied that this Princess
was already pledged to his nephew, Charles of
Lorraine, and laid stress on Margaret's charms and
learning. The Duke yielded, and a long wrangle
ensued as to the towns and citadels to be retained
by the French. But there was a still more thorny
question to be decided. This was the restoration of
Calais, which the English demanded with the utmost
pertinacity, while the French were no less determined
to keep their conquest. The English pleaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
that they had held the town during two centuries;
the French replied that it had been unjustly snatched
from them in the first place. Old treaties, going
back to the days of the Black Prince, were produced,
and Arras and his colleagues supported the English
claim loyally, knowing that, if Philip consented to
abandon Calais, he would lose all hold on his wife's
subjects. In vain Christina proposed that, as the
marriage of the French King's elder daughter with
the Infant Don Carlos had been agreed upon, Calais
should form part of Elizabeth's dower. The Cardinal
told the Duchess that the possession of the town,
which his brother had conquered, touched his honour
too closely for him to agree to the surrender, and
King Henry sent word that he would rather lose
his crown than give up Calais. So stern and intractable
were the French that the only thing to be
done was to adjourn the Conference and refer the
matter to the two monarchs.<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1558</span>] DEATH OF MARY OF HUNGARY</div>

<p>The Constable was allowed to go to Beauvais with
the Cardinal to consult King Henry, Alva and
Orange went to Brussels to see Philip, and Christina
took three days' holiday with her children at Douai.
Before she went to Cercamp, a report of Charles V.'s
death had reached Brussels. Now this was confirmed
by letters from St. Yuste, announcing that the
great Emperor had passed away on the 21st of
September. The sudden death of his sister Eleanor,
seven months before, had been a great shock to him,
and when the Queen of Hungary entered his room
without the accustomed figure at her side he burst
into tears. The recent events of the war, and Philip's
difficulties in the administration of the provinces,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>troubled him sorely, and he was very anxious for
Mary to resume the office of Regent. When, in
August, the Archbishop of Toledo brought a letter
from the King, imploring the Queen to come to his
help, Charles used all his influence to induce her
to consent. In vain Mary pleaded her advancing
years and failing health; the Emperor replied that
her refusal would bring ruin and disgrace on their
house, and adjured her by the love of God and her
sisterly affection to do him this last service. This
appeal decided the noble woman. On the 9th of
September she wrote to tell Philip that, in obedience
to his father's orders, she would start for the Netherlands
as soon as possible. The knowledge of the
Queen's decision was a great consolation to Charles
in his last moments, and as soon as she had recovered
from the first shock of his death she prepared to obey
his last wish. But before she embarked at Laredo,
a fresh attack of the heart trouble from which she
suffered ended her life, and on St. Luke's Day she
passed to her well-earned rest.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a></p>

<p>Her death was deeply lamented throughout the
Low Countries, where her return had been daily
looked for, and no one mourned her loss more truly
than the niece to whom she had been the best of
mothers. It was with a sad heart that Christina
came back to Cercamp to preside at the second
session of the Conference, which opened on the 7th
of November. Alarming accounts of their mistress's
health now reached the English Commissioners, and
Count Feria, whom Philip sent to London, wrote
that the Queen's life was despaired of, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
Parliament was in great alarm lest, if she died, the
King would cease to care for the recovery of Calais.
But, although Arras and Alva still declared that they
would never consent to any treaty which did not
satisfy the English, the French remained obdurate,
and the Commissioners were at their wits' end. The
Bishop of Ely was in tears, and on the 18th of
November Lord Arundel wrote home that</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"it seemed very hard that all others should have
restitution of their owne, and poore England, that
began not the fray, should bear the burthen and loss
for the rest, and specially of such a jewel as Calais."<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a></p></div>

<p>The next day came the news of the Queen's death.
The French, who, Wotton remarked, "have ears as
long as those of Midas," were the first to inform Her
Majesty's Envoys that their mistress had breathed
her last, on the morning of the 17th of November,
after sending a message to Elizabeth, recognizing
this Princess as her successor, and begging her to
maintain the Catholic religion. The new Queen at
once sent Lord Cobham to announce her accession
to Philip, and assure him of her resolve to hold fast
the ancient friendship between England and the
House of Burgundy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1558</span>] THE EMPEROR'S FUNERAL</div>

<p>The news of Mary's death decided the Commissioners
to adjourn the Conference. The truce
was prolonged for two months, and on the 2nd of
December they all left Cercamp. Arundel had already
started for England, and Wotton was longing to get
away, saying "that he was never wearier of any
place than he was of Cercamp, saving only of Rome
after the sack." The Constable was set at liberty,
and received a promise that his 200,000 crowns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>ransom should be reduced by half, if peace were
finally made. Arras, Alva, and Orange, went to
the Abbey of Groenendal to see Philip, who had
retired to pray for his father's soul, and there received
the tidings of his wife's death. Christina
returned to Brussels to assist at a succession of
funerals. On the 22nd of December a requeim for
the Queen of England was chanted in S. Gudule,
the Duke of Savoy acting as chief mourner in the
King's absence, and on the following day solemn
funeral rites for the late Queen of Hungary were
performed in the Court chapel, which she and the
Emperor had built and adorned. The Duchess of
Lorraine was present at this service, together with
the Duke of Savoy, the Prince of Orange, and all the
chief nobles and Crown officials, while the palace
gates were thronged with a crowd of sorrowing
people.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> But the grandest funeral ceremonies ever
known in Brussels were those that were celebrated
on the 29th of December, in memory of the late
Emperor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1559</span>] CHARLES'S WEDDING</div>

<p>Great preparations had been made for this solemnity
during the last few weeks. A <i>chapelle ardente</i>
was erected in S. Gudule, rising in tiers to the lofty
roof, adorned with golden diadems and shields
emblazoned with the dead monarch's arms and titles,
and lighted with 3,000 candles. Here, on a couch
draped with cloth of gold, an effigy of the Emperor
was laid, clad in robes of state and wearing the collar
of the Order. On the morning of the 29th a long
procession wound its way through the narrow streets
leading from the palace on the heights of the Caudenberg
to the cathedral church, and a stately pageant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
unfolded the glorious story of Charles of Austria's
deeds. A richly carved and gilded ship, drawn by
marine monsters, bore the names of his journeys and
battles and armorial bearings of the kingdoms over
which he reigned, while banners of the Turks and
of the other foes whom he had vanquished were
plunged in the waves below, and white-robed maidens
sat in the stern, bearing the cross and chalice, the
symbols of the faith by which he had conquered the
world. This imposing group was followed by a representation
of the Pillars of Hercules with Charles's
motto, <i>Plus oultre</i>, and twenty-four horses decked in
coloured plumes and trappings to match the banners
of his different States. Each of these pennons was
borne by a noble youth, while four Princes supported
the great standard of the Empire. Then came the
officers of the imperial household, leading Charles's
war-horse, and bearing his armour and insignia; the
Prince of Orange with his master's sword, Alva
with the orb of the world, and the Grand Commander
of Castille with the imperial crown. Last of all King
Philip himself appeared on foot, clad in a mourning
mantle five yards long, and followed by the Duke of
Savoy and a long train of Knights of the Golden Fleece,
Councillors and Ministers, with the Archers of the
Guard bringing up the rear. The procession left the
palace at nine, and the funeral service, which included
a lengthy oration by the Bishop of Arras's coadjutor,
Abb&eacute; Richardot, was not over till five o'clock. The
next day Philip and all his nobles attended High Mass,
and at the end of the celebration the Prince of Orange,
standing before the funeral pile, smote his breast
three times, repeating the words: "He is dead, and
will remain dead; and there is another risen up in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
place, greater than ever he has been." So the solemn
function ended.</p>

<p>"It was a sight worth going 100 miles to see,"
wrote Richard Clough, an English apprentice who
had been sent by Sir Thomas Gresham from Antwerp,
and counted himself fortunate to witness this imposing
ceremony. "The like of it, I think, hath
never been seen. The Lord give his soul rest!"<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a></p>

<p>The Duchess of Lorraine had been anxious that
her son should attend his great-uncle's funeral, but
the tardy invitation which Philip sent to Nancy
arrived too late, and the young Duke could not reach
Brussels in time to take part in the ceremony. To
console herself for this disappointment, Christina
went to meet Charles at Treves on the 6th of January,
and spent two days in his company, before he returned
to France for the wedding. His loyal subjects presented
him with a marriage gift of 200,000 crowns,
double the amount which any Duke of Lorraine had
received before. Charles who inherited his mother's
lavish generosity, spent most of the money in costly
jewels for his bride, and presented the King and
Dauphin, Vaudemont and the Guises, with superb
robes embroidered with the arms of Lorraine and
lined with lynx fur. The wedding was solemnized
at Notre Dame on the 22nd of January, with as much
splendour as that of the Dauphin in the previous
spring. The Guises held open house for ten days in
their palatial abode, the "H&ocirc;tel de Lorraine et de
Sicile," near the royal palace of Les Tournelles, and
gave a grand tournament in which the young Duke
appeared at the head of a troop splendidly arrayed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
in corslets of gold and silver, with the <i>al&eacute;rions</i>, or
eagles, of Lorraine on the crest of their helmets.
Ronsard celebrated the union of the eagles of Lorraine
and the golden lilies of France, and sang the praises
of the "Fair Maid of Valois and her bridegroom, the
beautiful Shepherd who feeds his flock in the green
pastures along the banks of Meuse and Moselle."<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p>

<p>The French King and Queen had invited the
Duchess in courteous and affectionate terms to be
present at the wedding, but she declined on the
plea of her deep mourning, as well as of the promise
which she had made to preside at the Peace Conference,
which was shortly to meet again.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1559</span>] AT C&Acirc;TEAU-CAMBR&Eacute;SIS</div>

<p>The Commissioners who had attended the Conferences
at Cercamp were unanimous in refusing to
return to this unhealthy and inconvenient spot, and
at the Duchess of Lorraine's suggestion the small
town of C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis, belonging to the Bishop
of Cambray, was chosen for their next meeting-place.
The Bishop's manor-house at Mon Soulas,
which had been damaged in the war, was hastily
repaired by the Duchess's <i>fourriers</i>, the rooms were
furnished anew, and paper windows were inserted
in place of the broken glass. The Bishop of Arras,
who arrived with the Prince of Orange's servants,
secured a decent lodging and good cook for himself
and his colleagues in the neighbouring villas of
Beau Regard and Mon Plaisir, while Wotton and the
Bishop of Ely found very indifferent quarters in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>ruinous house belonging to the Bishop of Cambray.
The French complained that the accommodation was
no better than at Cercamp, if the air was healthier, and,
after a good deal of grumbling, fixed on two houses,
known as Mon Secours and Belle Image, outside the
gates.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> The dilapidated country-house, with its
patched-up walls and paper windows, could hardly
have been a pleasant residence in the cold days of
February, but Christina made light of these discomforts,
and threw herself heart and soul into the
difficult task before her. The Commissioners all
recognized the tact and patience which she showed
in conducting the negotiations, and the courtesy
which the Ambassadors of other nationalities received
at her hands, during the next two months.</p>

<p>The French delegates were delayed by the f&ecirc;tes
for the Duke of Lorraine's wedding, and did not
reach C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis until late on the evening of
the 5th of February. On the following afternoon
they held their first meeting with the King of Spain's
Commissioners in the Duchess's rooms at Mon Soulas.
They seemed very cheerful, and, the next day being
Shrove Tuesday, were all entertained at dinner by
the Constable. On Ash Wednesday, Mass of the
Holy Ghost was sung in church, after which business
began in earnest, and various points regarding the
Duke of Savoy's marriage were decided. The next
evening Lord William Howard, who had been made
Lord Chamberlain by the new Queen, and advanced
to the peerage with the title of Lord Howard of
Effingham, arrived from England. He was received
with great civility by Alva and his colleagues, and
conducted by the Prince of Orange to salute the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
Duchess. Christina welcomed him graciously, asked
after Queen Elizabeth with great interest, and kept
him talking of England "for a pretty while" in the
most friendly manner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"This assembly," wrote Howard to his mistress,
"hath been entirely procured by the Duchess's
labour and travail; and she being a Princess not
subject to the King of Spain or France, the Commissioners
are content to use her as one that is indifferent

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1559</span>] ANGRY DISCUSSIONS</div>

<p>But the Frenchmen, Lord Howard complained,
behaved in a very strange fashion, and quite refused
to meet him and his colleagues if they persisted in
their demand for Calais, pretending that this question
had been finally settled at Cercamp. At Christina's
entreaty, however, the Cardinal consented to an
interview, and at one o'clock on Saturday, the 11th of
February, the whole body of Commissioners met at
Mon Soulas. The Duchess sat at the head of the
table, the English on her right, the French deputies
opposite, and Alva and his companions at the other
end. A long wrangle followed; all the old arguments
were revived, and the Cardinal, as Howard noticed,
did his best to stir up a quarrel between the English
and the King of Spain's servants. After the meeting
broke up, the members stood about in little knots,
conversing amicably with each other and the Duchess.
On Sunday the Constable had a long private interview
with Howard, and, as the latter afterwards discovered,
caught Alva and Stroppiana as they left
church, and tried to induce them to abandon the
English. But Philip's servants stood loyally by their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>allies, and the Prince of Orange and Alva discussed
the matter with Howard until a late hour. During
the next two days the debate was continued with
ever-increasing acrimony, until on Tuesday afternoon
Howard broke into so violent a passion that
the Cardinal and his friends rose and walked out of
the house, saying that it was impossible to argue with
such people. As Arras remarked shrewdly: "The
French are better advocates of a bad cause than the
English are of a good one."<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a></p>

<p>Presently a page brought the Duchess word that
the French Commissioners had ordered their horses,
and were preparing to pack up and leave. Upon this
Christina followed them into the garden, and by dint
of much persuasion prevailed upon the Cardinal to
listen to her suggestion that Calais should remain for
eight years in the hands of the French, and that a
yearly sum should be paid to Queen Elizabeth as a
security for its ultimate surrender. Meanwhile the
outer world was becoming very impatient. Philip
wrote to the Prince of Orange, saying that he could
get no more supplies from Spain, and that the greatest
service he could do him would be to obtain peace at
any cost; and Henry sent an autograph letter to the
Constable, complaining of the Guises' opposition,
ending with the words: "Never mind what these men
say; let them talk as they please, but make peace if
possible!" It was accordingly decided to refer the
Duchess's proposal to Queen Elizabeth and her
Council, while the Constable went to consult the
French King at Villers-Cotterets.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span></p>

<p>Late this same evening the Duke of Lorraine
arrived from Court, with two of the Guise Princes,
the Grand Prior of Malta, and the Marquis of Elb&#339;uf,
and was met by the Prince of Orange, and taken to
Mon Soulas. The Duchess was overjoyed to see her
son, and the next three days were devoted to hunting-parties.
Howard was invited to join in one of these,
and he and the Prince of Orange accompanied Christina
and Margaret of Aremberg out hunting. As they
rode home together, the ladies began to talk of
Queen Elizabeth, and Christina expressed her wish
that she would marry the King of Spain.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Why?" returned Howard. "What should my
mistress doe with a husband that should be ever
from her and never with her? Is that the way to
get what we desire most&mdash;that is, children? I think
not."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1559</span>] ROYAL INTERVIEWS</div>

<p>At this both the Duchess and Madame d'Aremberg
laughed, and Christina, remembering her unlucky
experiences at the English Court, observed that the
late Queen was too old to bear children, and had not
the art of winning her husband's affections. Howard
was entirely of the same opinion, but assured her that
whoever the present Queen chose to marry, "would
be honoured and served to the death by every one of
her subjects, and all the more so if he make much of
his wife."<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> This conversation was duly reported to
Elizabeth by Howard, who begged his royal mistress to
forgive his boldness, and not impute it to him as folly.
All the world knew that Philip was paying assiduous
court to his sister-in-law, and Christina's remarks
were no doubt prompted by the wish to do him a
good turn. But three weeks after this conversation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>the Queen told Count Feria that she was determined
to restore the Church of the land to what it was in
her father's time, and that, being a heretic, she could
not become his master's wife.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a></p>

<p>Christina had long sought an opportunity of
presenting her son to the King, and at her request
Philip agreed to come to Binche for hunting, and
meet the Duke at Mons. On the 22nd of February,
the Duchess and her son, accompanied by
Madame d'Aremberg, the Prince of Orange, and
the Guise Princes, rode to Mons, where they
were hospitably entertained by the Duke of
Aerschot, and received a visit from the King, who
came over on St. Matthias's Feast from Binche to
spend the day with his cousins. He showed himself
unusually amiable to the young Duke, and delighted
the boy with the gift of a richly carved and jewelled
sword, in memory of the great Emperor, whose
birthday fell on this day. On the 25th, Marguerite
d'Aremberg wrote to inform Arras that the Duchess
hoped to be back in a few days, and thanked</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"him for having her hall put in order, promising
the Bishop that, if he were seized with a wish to
dance when the ladies from the French Court arrived,
he should have the best place."<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p></div>

<p>Three days afterwards Christina returned to Mon
Soulas, bringing both her daughters to meet their
brother's wife, who was expected in a few days. The
conferences were resumed on the 2nd of March, but
there seemed little prospect of a settlement. The
Cardinal made more difficulties than ever, and even
ventured to question Queen Elizabeth's right to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>crown, saying that she was a bastard, and Mary,
Queen of Scots was the true Queen of England. Here
Christina intervened once more, and succeeded in
soothing down her irascible kinsman. But the
leading part taken by the Duchess in these debates
annoyed Arras seriously. He blamed her for playing
into the hands of the French, and complained to the
Duke of Savoy that there were too many ladies at
Mon Soulas, and that their absence would be of more
advantage than their presence. This last remark
was aimed at the young Duchess of Lorraine, who,
on the 5th of March arrived from Court with the
Duchess of Guise, Anna d' Este, and a numerous
suite of ladies. An innocent, simple girl, devoted to
her young husband, Claude responded warmly to the
affectionate welcome which she received from her
mother-in-law and sisters; and Christina thus surrounded
by her children, declared herself to be the
happiest of mothers. Everyone, as Arras complained,
was given up to amusement. Lord Howard went
out hunting with his old friend the Constable, and
the Prince of Orange and the Cardinal spent their
evenings with the Duchess and her joyous family
circle.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1559</span>] THE CALAIS QUESTION</div>

<p>On Saturday, the 12th of March, there was another
stormy meeting in the Duchess's rooms. This time
the French and Spanish Commissioners quarrelled
violently, and Alva and Arras left the room in anger,
declaring they had been fooled, and retired to their
own lodgings. In a private letter to the Duke of
Savoy, the Bishop complained bitterly of the Frenchmen's
insolence, saying that nothing could be "done
with such people by fair means, and the only way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>was to show your teeth."<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> The next afternoon, however,
at the Duchess's earnest entreaty, he and Alva
returned to the Conference. This time the Cardinal
was in a more amiable mood, and the terms originally
proposed by Christina were accepted by all parties.
Calais was to remain in the hands of France for eight
years, and hostages were to be given for the payment
of a yearly ransom of 500,000 crowns. There was
great rejoicing at this agreement, and the young
Duchess and her ladies returned to Court on the
19th of March, full of the goodness and generosity
of the Duke's mother, who loaded them with costly
presents, and gave her daughter-in-law the magnificent
jewelled necklace which had been the Emperor's
wedding gift on her marriage to the Duke of Milan.
Christina herself was now so convinced of the certainty
of peace that she begged her son to delay his
departure a few more days, in order that he might
take the good news to the Most Christian King. The
end of the Conference seemed really in sight, and
Lord Howard wrote to inform Queen Elizabeth of
the treaty regarding Calais, only to receive a sound
rating from his mistress for having dared to allow
the French and Spaniards to call her title in question.<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>The question of Calais having been settled, the
French and Spanish Commissioners met again on
the 13th of March, and conferred for six hours on
their own affairs. The Duke of Savoy's marriage
treaty was the chief point under discussion. Madame
Marguerite's own eagerness for the union was well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>known. She had repeatedly asked her friend the
Constable to press the matter, and on the 25th of
March she sent her <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, Monsieur de
l'H&ocirc;pital, to C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis to sign the contract
on her behalf. The Duke's original reluctance had
been overcome, and he sent Margaret word through
a friend that she must not think him ill-disposed
towards her, but that, on the contrary, he counted
himself fortunate to win so noble and accomplished
a bride, adding, with a touch of irony:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I believe that the fate with which you have
often threatened me is really in store for me, and
that I shall submit to be governed by a woman whom
I shall try to please."<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p></div>

<p>But there still remained some troublesome details to
arrange. All through Holy Week, Christina stayed
at her post, while the French and Spanish delegates
wrangled over the citadels to be given up by Henry
and Philip respectively. On Maundy Thursday a
sharp contest arose between Ruy Gomez and the Cardinal
on this point. Both parties left the room angrily,
and a complete rupture seemed imminent.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"They fell suddenly to such a disagreement,"
wrote Howard, "that they all rose up, determined
to break off and depart home the next morning, being
Good Friday."<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p></div>

<p>The Cardinal ordered his rooms to be dismantled
and his beds and hangings packed, and on Good
Friday morning he and his colleagues had already
put on their riding-boots, when Christina appeared
at the door and made a last appeal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1559</span>] CHRISTINA'S EFFORTS</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duchess," wrote the Venetian Tiepolo, "regardless
of personal fatigue, went to and fro between
the Commissioners, with the greatest zeal, ardour,
and charity, imploring them to come together
again."<a name="FNanchor_562" id="FNanchor_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a></p></div>

<p>Seven years before, on another Good Friday, in
her own palace, Christina had knelt in an agony of
grief at the King of France's feet, asking to be
allowed to keep her only son. To-day she pleaded
with tears and prayers, in the name of the same Christ
who died on the cross, for the suffering thousands
who were sighing for peace. This time her prayer
was heard. The Cardinal was induced to meet the
Spanish delegates once more, and, after a conference
which lasted over seven hours, it was decided that
King Philip should keep Asti and Vercelli, and
surrender all the other citadels which he held in Savoy.
Ruy Gomez hastened to the Abbey of Groenendal to
obtain his master's consent to this plan, and, to the
amazement of the whole Court, the Cardinal appeared
suddenly at La Fert&eacute; Milon, at dinner-time on Easter
Day. Happily, there was little difficulty in arranging
matters. Madame Marguerite told her brother plainly
that he ought not to let her marry the Duke, if he
treated him with suspicion, and Henry bade her be
of good cheer, for all would be well.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a></p>

<p>On Easter Tuesday the Commissioners held another
meeting at Mon Soulas, and by the following evening
the terms of the treaty were finally arranged. The
Cardinal embraced the young Princesses of Lorraine,
and the Duke bade his mother farewell, and rode off
as fast as his horse could take him to bear the good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>news to the French King. All the Commissioners
attended a solemn <i>Te Deum</i> in the church, and bonfires
were lighted in the town. "Thanks be to God!"
wrote the Constable to his nephew, Coligny: "Peace
is made, and Madame Marguerite is married."<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> One
point still awaited settlement. The Princess Elizabeth's
hand had been originally offered to Don
Carlos, but the Constable brought back word that
Henry would greatly prefer his daughter to wed King
Philip himself. The plan had already been mooted
at an earlier stage of the Conference, but it was not
until Philip saw that there was no hope of marrying
the Queen of England that he consented to wed the
French Princess. On the 2nd of April, when the
articles of the treaty were being drafted, the Constable
made a formal proposal from his master to
the Duchess, who, after a few words with Arras and
Ruy Gomez, graciously informed him that King
Philip was pleased to accept his royal brother's offer.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It seems a bold step," wrote Tiepolo, "for the
Catholic King to take to wife the daughter of the
Most Christian King, who had been already promised
to his son, especially as marriage negotiations with
the Queen of England are still pending. But, seeing
how this Queen has already alienated herself from the
Church, he has easily allowed himself to be brought
over to this plan, which will establish peace more
effectually, and will no doubt please the French,
who are above all anxious to keep him from marrying
the Queen of England."<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">April, 1559</span>] CONCLUSION OF PEACE</div>

<p>On the next morning the Commissioners met for
the last time, and signed the treaty, after which they
heard Mass and all dined with the Duchess, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>received the thanks and congratulations of the whole
body. Then they went their several ways, rejoicing,
in Arras's words, "to escape from purgatory."
Howard and his colleagues hastened home to make
their peace with the offended Queen. In spite of
her affected indifference, Elizabeth was by no means
gratified to hear of Philip's marriage. "So your
master is going to be married," she said with a smile
to Count Feria. "What a fortunate man he is!"
Presently she heaved a little sigh, and said: "But he
could hardly have been as much in love with me as
you supposed, since he could not await my answer a
few months."<a name="FNanchor_567" id="FNanchor_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a></p>

<p>Before leaving C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis, Christina sent
letters of congratulation to the French King and
Queen and to Madame Marguerite, expressing her
joy at the conclusion of the treaty, and the pleasure
which she had received from her son's presence. To
Henry II. she wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"It has pleased God to set the seal on all the joy
and content which I have experienced here&mdash;chiefly
owing to Your Majesty's kindness in allowing me
to see my son, and, after that, Madame your daughter
and her company&mdash;by bringing those long-drawn
negotiations to a good end, and concluding, not
only a lasting peace, but also the marriage of the
Catholic King with Madame Elizabeth. For all of
which I thank God, and assure Your Majesty that
I feel the utmost satisfaction in having been able to
bring about so excellent an arrangement, and one which
cannot fail to prove a great boon to Christendom."</p></div>

<p>In her letter to Catherine, Christina dwells chiefly
on her gratitude to the Queen and her daughter for
allowing her to keep her son so long.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I thank you, Madame," she writes, "very humbly
for your kind interest in our son, who is very well,
thank God, and I hope that the pleasure of seeing
you will prevent him from feeling the fatigues of the
journey. And I am greatly obliged to Your Majesty
and our daughter for having lent him to me so long.
I praise God that our negotiations have ended so
happily, and that these two great monarchs will henceforth
not only be friends, but closely allied by the
marriage of the Catholic King and Madame Elizabeth,
which, as you will hear, was frankly and joyfully
arranged after all the other articles of the treaty had
been drawn up. I rejoice personally to think that by
this happy arrangement I shall often have the pleasure
of seeing your Majesties, our daughter, and my son,
and take this opportunity of wishing you joy on this
auspicious event, hoping that in future you will not
fail to make use of me as of one who is ever ready to
do you service."<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p></div>

<p>The Duchess now returned to Brussels with her
daughters and the Prince of Orange. All the towns
and villages through which she passed were hung with
flags and garlands of flowers, and her coming was
hailed with shouts of joy. The prison doors were
thrown open, and the poor French soldiers, who had
languished in captivity for years, called down blessings
on her head.<a name="FNanchor_569" id="FNanchor_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> When she reached Brussels, the
King himself rode out to meet her, at the head of
his nobles, while courtiers and ladies flocked from all
parts to welcome her return and offer their congratulations
on the triumphant success of her labours. For
Christina it was a great and memorable day. The
bitterness of past memories was blotted out, and peace
and good-will seemed to have come back to earth.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1559</span>] REJOICINGS AT BRUSSELS</div>

<p>At Whitsuntide the Treaty was ratified. The Duke
of Lorraine came to Brussels with the Cardinals of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>Lorraine and Guise and the Constable, and spent a
fortnight with his mother. They were present in the
Court chapel, with Cardinals and Princes, when the
King, laying his hand on a relic of the True Cross,
took a solemn oath to keep the articles of the
Treaty. And Christina occupied the place of honour
at Philip's right hand at the state banquet in the
great hall, while her son and daughters and the
Duchess of Aerschot were all at table.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> The King
gave the Cardinal of Lorraine a service of gold plate
and a wonderful ship of rock-crystal studded with
gems, and bestowed similar presents on the Constable;
while the Marshal St. Andr&eacute;, being a poor man
was excused his ransom. They all left Flanders on the
following Sunday, except the Duke of Lorraine, who
remained another week with his mother. Before he
left Brussels, letters from Denmark were received, confirming
a report which had already reached the Court
of his grandfather King Christian II.'s death. The
old King had died in the Castle of Kallundborg, after
forty-five years of captivity, on the 25th of January,
1559, at the ripe age of seventy-seven. He was buried
with his parents in the Franciscan church at Odensee,
and Duke Adolf of Holstein followed his kinsman's
remains to their last resting-place. When her son
left Brussels, Christina put her household into mourning,
and retired to the Convent of La Cambre to spend
a month in retreat. After the strain and stress of the
last six months, she felt the need of rest sorely, and
the shelter of convent walls was grateful to her tired
soul.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a></p>

<h2>BOOK XIII<br />

THE RETURN TO LORRAINE<br />

1559-1578</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1559</span>] THE NETHERLANDS REGENCY</div>

<p>During the last year the Duke of Savoy had repeatedly
begged to be relieved of his post as the
King's Lieutenant in the Low Countries. By the
Treaty of C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis he recovered his dominions,
and set out on the 15th of June for Paris with a great
train of gentlemen and servants, to celebrate his
marriage with King Henry's sister. At the same
time, the death of the Emperor made Philip's return
to Spain necessary. The appointment of a new
Regent of the Netherlands became imperative, and
everyone expected the Duchess of Lorraine would be
chosen to fill the vacant office. A Habsburg by birth,
she inherited the capacity for governing which distinguished
the women of her house, and had proved
her fitness for the post by the wisdom with which she
administered her son's State during seven years. Her
popularity with all classes of people in the Netherlands
was an additional advantage, and when, in the summer
of 1558, it had been doubtful if Mary of Hungary
would consent to return, the Duchess was the first
person whose name was suggested. The Venetian
Suriano remarked that the only doubt as to her fitness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
for the office was that she hardly possessed her aunt's
extraordinary vigour and energy.<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> But these doubts
had been dispelled by the admirable manner in which
she had conducted the negotiations at the recent
Conference and the immense credit which she had acquired
on all sides. Unfortunately, she had made an
enemy of the Bishop of Arras, and excited his jealousy
by her private consultations with the Cardinal and
Constable, and still more by her friendship with the
Prince of Orange. Both Orange and Egmont disliked
the Bishop almost as much as they hated the King's
Spanish favourites, and lost no opportunity of showing
their contempt for the "meddling priest," as they
called Philip's confidential counsellor. And both of
these proud nobles, seeing no hope of themselves
obtaining the Regency, supported the Duchess's
claims strongly.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> But the very popularity which
Christina enjoyed, the acclamations which greeted
her return from C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis, had the effect of
arousing Philip's jealousy. He lent a willing ear to
Arras and Alva when they spoke scornfully of the
Duchess's French connection and of the influence
which the Prince of Orange would gain by his marriage
with her daughter. Then, in an evil hour both
for himself and the Netherlands, the Bishop suggested
the name of the Duchess of Parma. Margaret was
closely related to the King, and would be far more
pliable and ready to follow his counsels than Christina.
Philip liked his sister, and shared the Spaniards'
jealousy of the great Flemish nobles, more especially
of the Prince of Orange, whose intimacy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>with Christina he regarded with growing suspicion.
His mind was soon made up, and when the French
Commissioners came to Brussels in May, the appointment
of the Duchess of Parma to be Governess of
the Low Countries was publicly proclaimed.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a></p>

<p>The announcement was the signal for an outburst
of popular discontent. Orange and Egmont protested
loudly at this affront to the Duchess of Lorraine,
and complained of the indignity offered to the
nation by giving them a ruler of illegitimate birth,
whose interests and connections were all foreign, and
whose husband had actually borne arms against the
late Emperor.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"There is great discontent here," wrote Tiepolo,
"at the Duchess of Parma's appointment. The
common folk use very insolent language, and say
that if a woman is to reign over them they would far
rather have the Duchess of Lorraine, whom they
know and love and hold to be one of themselves.
Every one, indeed, would have greatly preferred this
Princess, who is of royal lineage on both sides, and has
long dwelt in these provinces, besides being far more
gracious and affable to the nobles."<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a></p></div>

<p>To Christina herself the blow was heavy. She had
suffered many trials and disappointments at her
enemies' hands, but had never expected to be treated
with such ingratitude by the King, who had always
professed so much affection for his cousin, and was so
deeply indebted to her.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1559</span>] CHRISTINA'S DISAPPOINTMENT</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duchess of Lorraine," wrote Tiepolo, "feels
the injustice of the King's decision more deeply than
any of her past adversities, and naturally thinks that,
after her long and indefatigable exertions in negotiating
this peace, taking part in every Conference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>and adjusting every dispute, she deserved to be treated
with greater regard. Everyone here admits that
peace was concluded chiefly owing to her wisdom and
efforts, and this is all the reward which she has
received."<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p></div>

<p>It is scarcely to be wondered at if Christina never
wholly forgave Philip for the cruel wrong which he
had done her, and if in all her future correspondence
with him we trace a strain of reproachful bitterness.
Her resolve to leave the Netherlands was now fixed.
She could not bear to see another Regent at Brussels,
and was not even sure if she cared to live as a subject
at her son's Court. Her thoughts turned once more
to Italy, and, since the Castles of Tortona and
Vigevano were not available, she addressed a petition
to Philip through her Italian secretary, asking him to
give her the duchy of Bari in Calabria. This principality,
once the property of Lodovico Sforza, had been
lately bequeathed to Philip by the late Queen Bona
of Poland, on condition that he would discharge a
considerable debt owing to her son, King Sigismund.
The beauty and salubrity of the spot, as well as its
association with the Sforzas, probably prompted
Christina's request, which ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duchess of Lorraine in all humility begs Your
Majesty, in consideration of her close relationship and
of the great affection which she bore the late Emperor,
and of the services which she has rendered both to
His Majesty of blessed memory and to yourself, to do
her the favour of granting her and her children the
duchy of Bari, with the same revenues and independent
liberties as were enjoyed by the Queen of Poland.
She will undertake to pay the King of Poland the sum
of 100,000 crowns due to him, and humbly begs Your
Majesty to grant her half of this amount in ready
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>money, the other half in bills on merchants' houses,
in order that she may be able to pay the creditors who
annoy her daily. Her revenues for the next year are
already mortgaged, owing to the necessity laid upon
her of supporting her daughters, during the last seven
years, and the repeated journeys which she has undertaken
to England, and across the French frontier to
treat of peace, all of which have involved her in great
and heavy expenses...."</p></div>

<p>Here the petition breaks off abruptly, the rest of
the page being torn off; but we see by Philip's reply
that it contained a bitter complaint of the injustice
which he had done Christina by refusing to make
her Regent. He wrote to Arras, desiring him to see
that the Duchess ceased to repeat these perpetual
recriminations on the subject of the Regency, which
were as derogatory to her dignity as they were injurious
to his interests. He regretted that his own pressing
needs made it impossible for him to do as much as he
should wish to help her. At the same time he said
that, besides the revenue of 4,000 crowns which he
had already offered her, and which she had neither
refused nor accepted, he was ready to give her
another yearly allowance of 10,000 crowns, to be
charged on Naples and Milan, pointing out that she
could raise money on this income to satisfy her
creditors.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1559</span>] WILLIAM OF ORANGE</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The sincere affection which the King has always
felt for the Duchess, and the closeness of their relationship,"
added the writer, "impels him to advise her to
retire to her dower lands of Lorraine and live near her
son, in order that she may foster the loyalty and devotion
which this young Prince owes her, and give him
advice and help that may conduce to his welfare and
that of the House of Lorraine. Any other action on
her part, the King is convinced, will only excite
public suspicion and slander. If, however, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>Duchess prefers to live in the kingdom of Naples, the
King is ready to offer her the town of Lecce, the most
important next to the capital, where she can enjoy
all the comforts and amenities of Italian life, together
with the respect due to her exalted birth and rank."<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a></p></div>

<p>This offer, however, did not commend itself to
Christina. In spite of its ancient castle and beautiful
situation, Lecce was not an independent principality,
and had no connection with her family. She replied
curtly that she would follow His Majesty's advice and
return to Lorraine, as soon as her creditors were satisfied
and her affairs sufficiently arranged for her to
leave the Netherlands with honour. Upon this,
Philip sent the Duchess a sum of 21,000 crowns to
defray the expenses of her journeys, and a further
substantial advance on the additional revenues which
he had assigned her.<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a></p>

<p>But while he was outwardly endeavouring to atone
for one act of injustice, he was secretly doing the
Duchess another and a more serious injury. The
marriage of the Prince of Orange with her daughter
Ren&eacute;e had been practically arranged at C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis,
but some difficulties had arisen regarding
the settlements already made by the Prince on his
two children by his first marriage, and the heavy
debts which he had incurred by his extravagance,
amounting, it was said, to 900,000 crowns. Up to
this time Philip had openly encouraged the Prince's
suit, but both he and Arras looked with alarm on a
marriage that would make Orange more powerful and
more dangerous than he was already, and were secretly
plotting against its conclusion. One day, when Philip
was walking in the park at Brussels with the Prince,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>he told him how much he regretted to find that
Madame de Lorraine was strongly opposed to his
marriage with her daughter, and had begged him to
inform the Prince that she must decline to proceed
further with the matter. The King added, in a
friendly way, that he had told him this in order that
he might look about for another wife while he was
still young. The Prince was naturally much annoyed
at this unexpected communication, and replied
proudly that, if this were the case, he would promptly
seek another alliance in Germany, where he had
already received several offers of marriage. He was
deeply wounded, not without reason, and went off to
Paris a few days later, with Egmont and Alva, to
remain there as hostages until the conditions of the
treaty had been fulfilled. It was not until many
months afterwards that he discovered how he had
been duped. Christina meanwhile remained in her
convent retreat, unconscious of what was happening
in her absence, and heard with some surprise that the
Prince of Orange had left Court without informing
her of his departure.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">July, 1559</span>] MARGARET OF PARMA REGENT</div>

<p>All eyes were now turned to the Palais des Tournelles
in Paris, where the Catholic King's marriage to
Elizabeth of France, and that of the Duke of Savoy
to Margaret, were about to be celebrated. Alva
represented his master at the wedding, which was
solemnized at Notre Dame on the 22nd of June, and
his old enemy Guise proclaimed the new Queen's
titles at the church doors, and flung handfuls of gold
to the applauding crowds. But their joy was soon
changed into mourning. King Henry was mortally
wounded by a splintered lance in the tournament that
followed, and, after lingering for ten days, breathed
his last on the 10th of July, two days after the marriage
of his sister and the Duke of Savoy had been
quietly solemnized in the neighbouring church of
St. Paul.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span></p>

<p>The news of his father-in-law's death reached Philip
at Ghent, where he was preparing for his departure.
Here Christina joined him on the 19th, and was greeted
with the liveliest demonstrations of affection from
both Court and people. Before leaving Brussels, she
saw an English gentleman, who was on his way
to Italy, and brought her a pressing invitation
from Queen Elizabeth to pay a visit to England.<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
Elizabeth had evidently not forgotten the Duchess's
friendly intentions on her behalf when she came to
London in Mary's reign, nor her more recent conversation
with Lord Howard. After her arrival at Ghent,
she received frequent visits from Chaloner, the newly
appointed Ambassador, and from the French Envoy,
S&eacute;bastien de l'Aubespine, who had been one of the
delegates to the Conference, and could not speak too
highly of Madame de Lorraine's goodness and ability.
Through him she sent affectionate messages to the
young King Francis II. and his Scottish wife, thanking
them in the warmest terms for their kindness to her
son. Nor was Philip lacking in his attentions. He met
the Duchess on her arrival, paid her daily visits, and
seemed to fall once more under the old spell. On the
24th he and Christina were both present at a Requiem
for the King of France, and dined together afterwards.
The same afternoon Philip rode out to receive the
Duchess of Parma.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> The next day the Duke of Savoy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>returned from Paris, bringing with him the Prince of
Orange and Egmont, who were released on parole, and
attended the Chapter of the Fleece held by the King
in the Church of St. John. On the 7th of August the
States met, and the new Regent was formally presented
to them. But many voices were raised to
protest against the powers conferred upon her, and
the States refused to grant the aids demanded unless
the Spanish troops were withdrawn. This act of
audacity roused Philip's anger, and in his farewell
interview with William of Orange he accused him of
being the instigator of the measure.</p>

<p>Before leaving Ghent, the King arranged a meeting
between the two Duchesses in the garden of the
Prinzenhof, and afterwards invited Christina to visit
him at Flushing, where he spent some days before he
embarked. They dined together for the last time
on the 12th of August, and seem to have parted
friends.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Then Christina returned to Brussels to
prepare for her own departure, and Chaloner wrote
home:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I heare say the Duchess of Lorraine repaireth
shortly hence into Lorraine, smally satisfied with
the preferment of the other, for old emulations'
sake."<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1559</span>] RIVALRY OF THE DUCHESSES</div>

<p>During the next two months Christina had much
to endure. She found a marked change in the Prince
of Orange. He treated her with profound respect
and courtesy in public, but kept aloof from her in
private, and appeared to have transferred his attentions
to Margaret of Parma. All idea of his marriage
with Ren&eacute;e&mdash;"the Duchess of Lorraine's sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>limbed
daughter," as she was called by Chaloner&mdash;seemed
to be abandoned, and in September he left
Court to attend the French King's coronation at Reims.
There was a general feeling of discontent abroad.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The new Regent is greatly disliked," wrote John
Leigh, an English merchant of Antwerp, "by all
estates, who wished to have the Duchess of Lorraine
for their ruler, and some of her own ladies have
told her that she is a bastard, and not meet for
the place."</p></div>

<p>The States refused to grant the subsidies asked for,
and the people clamoured for the removal of the
Spaniards. The nobles showed their displeasure by
retiring to their country-houses, and the ladies absented
themselves from Margaret's receptions to meet
in the Duchess of Lorraine's rooms.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> This naturally
provoked quarrels and jealousies, which, as Arras
remarked in his letters to Philip, might easily prove
serious.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Then there is rivalry between the Duchess of
Lorraine and her of Parma," wrote the Bishop on the
4th of October, at the end of a long tale of troubles.
"The best way would be to keep them apart, for all
these comings and goings can produce no good result.
Fortunately, the former is about to go to Lorraine.
We shall see if she leaves her daughters here, or takes
them with her. What is certain is that, wherever
she and her daughters may be, it will be better for
Your Majesty's service they should be anywhere but
here, as long as Madame de Parma remains in these
parts, and discord prevails between her and the
Duchess."<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a></p></div>

<p>When Arras wrote these words, Christina was already
on her way to Lorraine. Philip received a
letter from her at Toledo, informing him of her final
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>departure, and wrote to tell Arras that all strife
between the Duchesses was now at an end.<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> In the
same month a marriage was arranged between
William of Orange and Anna of Saxony, the Elector
Maurice's daughter. Arras was greatly alarmed
when he heard of this alliance with a Protestant Princess,
and used all his powers of persuasion to induce
the Prince to return to his old suit and marry Mademoiselle
de Lorraine. But it was too late. The
Prince knew that the Duchess would never forgive
the studied neglect with which he had treated her,
and, as he told the Bishop, his word was already
pledged. A year later he married the Saxon Princess,
but lived to repent of this ill-assorted union, and to
realize that he had been the dupe of Philip and his
astute Minister.<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1559</span>] MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS</div>

<p>Christina's return to Lorraine took place at an
eventful moment. The death of Henry II. and the
accession of Francis II. placed the supreme power in
the hands of the Guise brothers. As the saying ran,
"So many Guise Princes, so many Kings of France."
The elder branch of the House of Lorraine shared in
the triumphs of the younger. The reigning Duke,
Charles, had grown up with the young King and
Queen, and was tenderly beloved by them. Francis
could not bear his brother-in-law to be absent from
his side, and after his coronation at Reims, on the
18th of September, he and Mary accompanied the
Duke and Duchess on a progress through Lorraine.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>The festival of the Order of St. Michel was held at
Bar, where Charles kept open house for a week, and
his aunt, Anne of Aerschot, came to join the family
party and meet the daughter of her old companion,
Mary of Guise. The charms of the young Queen won
all hearts in her mother's native Lorraine, and
Francis indulged his passion for sport in the forests
of Nom&eacute;ny and Esclaron.<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a></p>

<p>Here, at this favourite hunting-lodge of the Guises,
the royal party were joined by the Duke's mother.
Christina reached Esclaron on the 11th of October,
and was received with every mark of respect and
affection. At first, if Brant&ocirc;me is to be believed,
the Duchess-mother was inclined to stand on her
dignity, and refused to yield precedence to the youthful
Queen; but Mary's grace and sweetness soon dispelled
all rivalry, and Christina became the best of
friends with both the King and Queen. General
regret was expressed at the absence of the young
Princesses, whom their mother had left at Brussels;
but Christina was aware of the Cardinal's anxiety to
arrange a marriage between Ren&eacute;e and the Prince of
Joinville, and had no intention of consenting to this
arrangement.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"She left her daughters behind her," wrote Throckmorton,
the English Ambassador, "because she is
unwilling to satisfy the hopes of the House of Guise,
and makes not so great an account of their advances
as to leave the old friendship of King Philip and
his countries. The French, in fact," he adds, "are
doing all they can to make the Duchess Dowager a
good Frenchwoman, but they will not find it as easy
as they think."<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span></p>

<p>At the end of the week Christina went on to Nancy
with her son and daughter-in-law, leaving the King
and Queen to proceed to Joinville, where Mary was
anxious to see her beloved grandmother. She had
already appointed Antoinette and her three daughters-in-law
to be her ladies-in-waiting, and, as a further
proof of affection, had given her grandmother the
present which she received from the city of Paris on
her state entry. From Blois, where the royal pair
spent the autumn and winter, Francis II. sent his
brother-in-law the following letter, which throws a
pleasant light on the happy relations existing between
the two families:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">My dear Brother</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"I am longing for news of you and my sister,
and have not heard from either of you since you
reached Nancy. Next week I take my sister, the
Catholic Queen, to Ch&acirc;telh&eacute;rault on her way to Spain,
after which I shall return to Blois, and not move
again before Easter. As you may imagine, I cannot
be in this house without missing you very much. I
shall await your return with the utmost impatience,
and wish you were here to enjoy the fine rides which
I have made in my forest. I must thank you for
the good cheer that you are giving my sister, which
is the best proof of your perfect love for me. And I
am quite sure that in this you are helped by my aunt
your mother, Madame de Lorraine, for whom I feel
the deepest gratitude, and whom I should like to
assure of my readiness and anxiety to do her every
possible service. And I pray God, my dearest
brother, to have you in His holy keeping."<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1559</span>] CHRISTINA RETURNS TO NANCY</div>

<p>The young Duke and Duchess were both of them
longing to accept this pressing invitation and return
to the gay French Court. Charles as yet took little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>interest in public affairs which required serious
attention. Confusion reigned in every department.
In many instances the ducal lands had been seized
and their revenues appropriated to other uses, while
the whole country had suffered from the frequent
incursions of foreign troops, and famine and distress
prevailed in many districts. Under these circumstances
the help of the Duchess-mother was sorely
needed. Vaudemont, having neither health nor
capacity to cope with these difficulties, had retired
into private life, and by degrees Christina resumed
most of her old functions. She applied herself to
reforming abuses and restoring order in the finances,
and at the same time helped her son and daughter-in-law
in entertaining the nobles who flocked to Nancy
to pay them homage. Her daughters came to join her
at Christmas, and she settled once more in her old
quarters in the ducal palace. In March the Duke
returned to the French Court, and his mother was
left to act as Regent during his absence.<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">[590]</a></p>

<p>After visiting Remiremont and Bar, Charles and
his wife went on to spend the summer with the King
and Queen at Amboise, where they gave themselves
up to hunting and dancing, and enjoyed suppers at
Chenonceaux and water-parties on the Loire. But
this joyous life was rudely disturbed by the discovery
of a Huguenot conspiracy, which was put down with
ruthless severity, and was followed by continual
alarms. The King and Duke had to be escorted by
500 men-at-arms on their hunting-parties, and the
Cardinal of Lorraine never left his room without a
guard of ten men bearing loaded pistols. On the
10th of June Mary of Guise died in Edinburgh Castle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
and her remains were brought back to her native
land and buried in her sister's convent church,
St. Pierre of Reims. The whole Court went into
mourning, and Throckmorton was so moved by the
young Queen's tears that he declared "there never
was a daughter who loved her mother better."<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a>
Meanwhile the aspect of affairs grew daily more
threatening. There were riots in the provinces, and
rumours of plots at Court. The Duke of Lorraine was
present at the Council held at St. Germain for the
defence of the realm, but left for Nancy when the Court
moved to Orleans in October.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1561</span>] LA REINE BLANCHE</div>

<p>Two months later the young King died there very
suddenly. He fainted at vespers one evening, and
passed away at midnight on the 5th of December,
1560. His brother Charles, a boy of ten, was proclaimed
King in his stead, and his mother, Catherine
de' Medici, assumed the Regency. Three days afterwards
Throckmorton wrote that the late King was
already forgotten by everyone but his widow, who,
"being as noble-minded as she is beautiful, weeps passionately
for the husband who loved her so dearly,
and with whom she has lost everything." The young
Queen behaved with admirable discretion. On the
day after the King's death she sent the Crown jewels
to her mother-in-law, and, as soon as the funeral had
been solemnized, begged leave to go and visit her
mother's grave at Reims. After spending three weeks
with her aunt, Abbess Ren&eacute;e, Mary went to stay with
her grandmother at Joinville, where she was joined
by Anne of Aerschot, the one of all her mother's
family to whom she clung the most closely, calling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>her "ma tante," and consulting her in all her
difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a></p>

<p>Christina herself was full of sympathy for this
young Queen, whose early widowhood recalled her
own fate, and she joined cordially in the invitation
which the Duke sent Mary to pay a visit to Nancy.
"The Queen of Scotland," wrote Throckmorton to
Elizabeth on the 1st of May, 1561, "is at Nancy with
the Dowager, whom here they call Son Altesse."
Christina rode out with her son to meet their guest
on the frontiers of Lorraine, and her uncles, the two
Cardinals, Aumale, Vaudemont, and the Duchess of
Aerschot, all accompanied her to Nancy.</p>

<p>The touching beauty of the young widow created
a profound sensation at the Court of Lorraine. Brant&ocirc;me
describes her as "a celestial vision"; Ronsard
sang of the charms which transfigured <i>son grand
deuil et tristesse</i>, and made her more dangerous in this
simple white veil that rivalled the exquisite delicacy
of her complexion than in the most sumptuous robes
and dazzling jewels; and Clouet drew his immortal
portrait.<a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> The Duke arranged a series of f&ecirc;tes to
distract the young Queen's mind and help to dry her
tears. There were masques and dances at Nancy,
hunting-parties and banquets at Nom&eacute;ny, where
Mary stood godmother to the Count Vaudemont's
youngest child; and the Court was gayer than it had
been for many years. But intrigue was once more rife
at the French Court, and all manner of proposals
were made for the young widow's hand. The King of
Denmark, Frederic III., the Prince of Orange, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>Archduke Charles, the Dukes of Bavaria and Ferrara,
were all suggested as possible husbands. The fascination
which Mary had for the boy-King Charles IX.
was well known, and Catherine de' Medici, who had
never forgiven Mary for calling her a shopkeeper's
daughter, was secretly plotting to keep her away
from the Court, and yet prevent her marriage to Don
Carlos, whom she wished to secure for her youngest
daughter, Margot. The Cardinal of Lorraine was
known to be eager for the Spanish marriage, and both
Christina and Anne did their best to forward his
scheme, which was the subject of many letters that
passed between Granvelle, the Duchess of Aerschot,
and Mary herself. But Philip, without actually declining
the offer, always returned evasive answers,
whether he shrank from placing his sickly and wayward
son in an independent position, or whether he
feared the power of the Guise faction.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1561</span>] CORONATION OF CHARLES IX.</div>

<p>In the midst of the festivities at Nancy, Mary fell ill
of fever, and as soon as she was fit to travel returned
to Joinville, to be nursed by her grandmother; while
Christina accompanied her son and his wife to Reims
for the new King's sacring on the 15th of May. The
magnificence of the Duchess-mother's appearance on
this occasion excited general admiration. Grief and
anxiety had left their traces on her face, but, in spite
of advancing years and sorrow, Christina was still a
very handsome woman. Among all the royal ladies
who met in the ancient city, none was more stately
and distinguished-looking than Madame de Lorraine.
As her chariot, draped with black velvet fringed with
gold, and drawn by four superb white horses of Arab
breed, drew up in front of the Cardinal's palace, a
murmur of admiration ran through the crowd. The
Duchess sat at one window, clad in a long black velvet
robe, and wearing a jewelled diadem on her head, with
a flowing white veil and cap of the shape that became
known at the French Court as <i>&agrave; la Lorraine</i>, and was
adopted by Mary, Queen of Scots, for her habitual use.
At the other sat her lovely young daughter Ren&eacute;e,
the coveted bride of many of the Princes who were
present that day, while on the opposite seat was the
Princess of Macedonia, an august white-haired lady,
with the chiselled features of the proud Greek race to
which she belonged. The Queen-mother, Catherine de'
Medici, stood at a window of the Archbishop's palace
to watch the entry of the Lorraine Princes, and as
she saw the Duchess alight, she exclaimed: "That is
the finest woman I know!" Then, descending the
grand staircase, she advanced to meet Christina with
a stately courtesy, and thanked her for the honour she
was doing her son.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Herself a very proud woman," writes Brant&ocirc;me,
"she knew that she had her match in the Duchess,
and always treated her with the highest honour and
distinction, without ever yielding one jot of her own
claims."<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a></p></div>

<p>The Duke of Lorraine bore the sword of state at
the great ceremony on the morrow, while Francis of
Guise held the crown on the boy-King's head, and
his brother, the Cardinal, anointed his brow with the
holy chrism. "Everything," as Charles IX. wrote
to the Bishop of Limoges, "passed off to the great
satisfaction of everyone present;"<a name="FNanchor_596" id="FNanchor_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> and when all was
over, Madame de Lorraine and her children accompanied
the King and his mother to a country-house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>belonging to the Cardinal in the neighbourhood, and
enjoyed a week's repose in delicious spring weather.
Then the Court went on to St. Germain, where the
Queen of Scots came to take leave of her husband's
family, and with many tears bade farewell to the
pleasant land of France, which she had loved all too
well for her own happiness.</p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1561</span>] DEATH OF DOROTHEA</div>

<p>On the death of Christian II. of Denmark, his elder
daughter, Dorothea, the widowed Electress Palatine,
assumed the royal style and title. But as she was
childless herself, and lived in retirement at Neuburg,
in the Upper Palatinate, the faithful subjects who still
clung to their rightful monarch's cause turned to
Christina, the Duchess-Dowager of Lorraine, and
begged her to assert her son's claims to the throne,
saying that they regarded him as their future King.
Chief among these was Peder Oxe, an able public
servant who had been exiled by Christian III., and
came to visit the Duchess in the convent of La
Cambre at Brussels in 1559, soon after the captive
monarch's death. Peder tried to enlist her sympathies
on behalf of her father's old subjects, and
assured her that the recovery of Denmark would be
an easy matter, owing to the unpopularity of the new
King, Frederic III. At first Christina lent a willing
ear to these proposals, but her friend Count d'Aremberg
succeeded in convincing her of the futility of
such an enterprise, while both Philip and Granvelle
firmly refused to support the scheme.<a name="FNanchor_597" id="FNanchor_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> Peder Oxe,
however, followed Christina to Nancy, where he be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>came
a member of the Ducal Council, and did good
service in restoring order in the finances.</p>

<p>Other Danish exiles sought refuge at the Court of
Lorraine, where their presence naturally revived
Christina's dreams of recovering her father's throne.
All manner of rumours were abroad. In March, 1561,
Chaloner heard that the French King and the Duke
of Lorraine were about to invade Denmark. Three
months later Mary, Queen of Scots' faithful servant,
Melville, wrote from Heidelberg that the Duchess-Dowager
of Lorraine had come there to persuade her
sister, the old Countess Palatine, to surrender her
rights on Denmark to her nephew, the Duke of
Lorraine. Christina spent some time with her
sister, and was joined in September by the Duke, who
came to escort her home.<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> The Palatine Frederic's
successor, Otto Heinrich, had died in 1559, and his
cousin, the reigning Elector, Frederic of Zimmern,
the brother of the Countess Egmont and her sister
Helene, was deeply attached to Dorothea, and, like
his predecessor, professed the Lutheran faith. A
year after Christina's visit Dorothea died suddenly at
Neuburg, and was buried by her husband's side in
the Church of the Holy Ghost at Heidelberg. The
Palatine Frederic erected a fine monument over her
grave, with the following inscription:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"To the most noble Lady, Dorothea, Countess
Palatine, and Queen of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway,
the beloved consort of the Elector Frederic II.,
this tomb was raised by Frederic III., by the grace of
God Elector Palatine, in the year 1562, as a token of
love and gratitude to this his most dear and excellent
kinswoman."</p></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span></p>
<p>Dorothea's tomb was destroyed with that of her
husband and many others when Louis XIV.'s armies
sacked and burnt Heidelberg in 1693, but an English
traveller who visited the castle and Church of the
Holy Ghost thirty years before, preserved this inscription
in his diary.<a name="FNanchor_599" id="FNanchor_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1563</span>] DUKE OF GUISE'S MURDER</div>

<p>Christina came to Heidelberg with her son and both
her daughters in the autumn of the year 1562, and
was present at Frankfurt on the 24th of November,
when her cousin Maximilian was crowned King of
the Romans. On this occasion the Emperor Ferdinand
collected as many of the imperial family as
possible around him. The Dukes and Duchesses of
Bavaria and Cleves were present, as well as most
of the Electors and Princes of the Empire; while
Ibrahim Bey, the Sultan's Ambassador, brought
camels and rugs and Persian jars as gifts from his
master. Among the old friends whom the Duchess
met at Frankfurt were the Prince of Orange, Counts
Egmont and Jacques d'Aremberg. They greeted her
with renewed friendliness, and from their lips she
heard how badly things were going in the Low
Countries, and how unpopular the Regent and her
Minister, the newly-created Cardinal de Granvelle,
had become with all classes of people.<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> The Emperor
and all his family returned to Heidelberg after the
coronation, and were splendidly entertained by the
Palatine, who was anxious to arrange a marriage
between one of his sons and Mademoiselle de Lorraine.
But Frederic's strong Lutheran tenets were a
serious obstacle to this plan. At the recent coronation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>he had refused to attend Mass, and had remained
in the vestry of the cathedral until the service was
over.</p>

<p>Meanwhile religious strife was raging in France, and
Christina returned to Nancy to find that civil war had
broken out. Earlier in the year the massacre of a
peaceable congregation at Wassy, near Joinville,
had excited the fury of the Huguenots, and a fierce
struggle was being waged on the frontiers of Lorraine.
The Duke's own kindred were divided. Cond&eacute;
was the leader of the revolted party, while his brother
Antoine, King of Navarre&mdash;l'&Eacute;changeur, as he was
called, because he was said to change his religion as
often as he did his coat&mdash;was mortally wounded,
fighting on the King's side, in the siege of Rouen.
A month later the Constable de Montmorency was
made prisoner in the Battle of Dreux, by his own
nephew Coligny. On the 21st of February, 1563,
Christina and her son were attending the baptism of
the Duke of Aumale's son Claude, when a messenger
arrived with the news that the Duke of Guise had
been stabbed by a Huguenot fanatic in the camp
before Orleans. After a public funeral in Notre
Dame, the remains of Antoinette's most illustrious
son were buried at Joinville, amid the lamentations
of the whole nation.<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a></p>

<p>Fortunately, the duchy of Lorraine escaped the
horrors of civil war. On the 18th of May, 1562,
Charles made his long-deferred state entry into
Nancy, and took a solemn vow to observe the rights
of his subjects before he received the ducal crown.
But he still consulted his mother in all important
matters, and treated her with the utmost respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[Pg 472]</a></span>
and affection.<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> His own time and thoughts were
chiefly occupied in enlarging and beautifying the
ducal palace. He extended the Galerie des Cerfs,
and built a fine hall, adorned with frescoes of the
Metamorphoses of Ovid, a translation of which had
been dedicated to his grandfather, Duke Antoine, by
the poet Clement Marot. At the same time he rebuilt
the old Salle du Jeu de Paume on the model of
one at the Louvre, and made a picture-gallery above
this new hall, which he hung with portraits of the
ducal family.<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a></p>

<p>Christina also devoted much attention to the improvement
of her estates. She rebuilt the salt-works
at Les Rosi&egrave;res, which had been abandoned in the last
century, and placed an inscription on the gates,
recording that in February, 1563, these salt-works
were erected by</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Christina, by the grace of God Queen of Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway, Sovereign of the Goths, Vandals,

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1563</span>] BIRTH OF A GRANDSON</div>

<p>Several indications of the active part that she took
in affairs of State appear in contemporary records.
In 1564, with the Pope's sanction, she concluded an
agreement with the Bishop of Toul, by which he made
over his temporalities to the Duke of Lorraine.
Christina, as she explained to Granvelle, had taken
this step to avoid the see from becoming the property
of France; but her action roused the indignation of
her uncle, the Emperor Ferdinand, who rebuked his
good niece sharply for venturing to meddle with the
affairs of the Imperial Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a></p>

<p>On the 8th of November, 1563, the Duchess Claude
gave birth to her first child, a boy which was named
Henry, after her father, the late King of France.
Both Charles IX. and Philip II. consented to stand
godfathers, and the French King announced his intention
of attending the child's christening in person.
His visit, however, was put off, as the young Duchess
fell seriously ill of smallpox, and was eventually fixed
to take place at Bar after Easter. There was even a
rumour that King Philip, whose presence in the Low
Countries was earnestly desired, would visit Lorraine
on his journey, and meet the French monarch on the
1st of May. The prospect of seeing Catherine and
her son with an armed force in Lorraine filled Christina
with alarm. The Queen-mother, as she knew, was
very jealous of the Duchess-Dowager's influence with
her son, and neglected no means of placing French
subjects in positions of authority at the Ducal Court;<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a>
while her recent intrigues with the Huguenot leaders
might lead to the introduction of Protestant rites at
the ceremony. Before the date fixed for the christening,
however, Christina received an unexpected visitor
in the person of Cardinal Granvelle, who had been
compelled to bow to the storm and leave the Netherlands.
In a private note which he sent to Granvelle
on the 1st of March, 1564, Philip had desired the
Cardinal to retire to Besan&ccedil;on on plea of paying
a visit to his mother, whom he had not seen for
nineteen years. The desired permission was readily
granted by the Regent, and, to the great satisfaction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>of the nobles, the hated Minister left Brussels on the
13th of March. "Our man is really going," wrote
William of Orange to his brother Louis. "God grant
he may go so far that he can never return!"<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1564</span>] GRANVELLE AT NANCY</div>

<p>The Cardinal had by this time recognized his fatal
mistake in persuading the King to appoint the
Duchess of Parma Regent instead of Madame de
Lorraine, "by which action," as he himself wrote,
"I made the Prince of Orange my enemy."<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> He
was the more anxious to recover Christina's good
graces, while she on her part does not appear to have
borne him any grudge for his share in the transaction.
His way led him through Lorraine, and when he
reached Pont-&agrave;-Mousson he found a messenger from
the Duchess begging him to come and see her at
Nancy. On his arrival he was received by the
Duke's <i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, and conducted to lodgings in
the palace. This "very fine house," and the hospitality
with which he and his companions were entertained,
gratified the Cardinal, and after supper he
was received by the Duchess-Dowager, with whom he
had a long interview in the Grande Galerie.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> They
conversed freely of the troubles in the Netherlands.
Christina was anxious to justify herself from the charge
of fomenting these dissensions, and declared that
she had nothing to say against the Duchess of Parma,
and only complained of her refusal to allow a Mass
for her father, King Christian II., to be said in the
Court chapel on the anniversary of his death. But
she had many complaints to make of the King, who
had only written to her five times in the last five
years, and who insisted on keeping her Castle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>Tortona in his own hands, and employed the revenues
of the town to pay the garrison, without giving her
any compensation. Granvelle could only allege the
unsettled state of Lombardy and the disorder of
Milanese finances as excuses for Philip's behaviour.
The Duchess further confided to him her fears regarding
the French King's visit, and the intrigues of
Catherine, who was always endeavouring to destroy
the harmony that prevailed between herself and her
daughter-in-law. Granvelle did his best to allay
these alarms, and assured her that the rumours as
to the large force that was to accompany him to
Lorraine were absolutely false.</p>

<p>Another subject on which Christina consulted the
Cardinal was her designs against Denmark. The
young King Frederic III. at first professed great
friendship for her, and opened negotiations for his
marriage with her daughter Ren&eacute;e&mdash;a proposal which
she was reluctant to accept.<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> This idea, however, was
soon abandoned, and the outbreak of war between
Denmark and Sweden seemed to afford an opportunity
for advancing her own claims. Peder Oxe and
his companion in exile, Willem von Gr&uuml;mbach, urged
her to raise an army and invade Jutland, assuring her
that the discontented Danish nobles were only longing
for an excuse to rise in a body and dethrone the
usurper. But Christina realized that it would be
useless to make any attempt without Philip's support,
which she begged Granvelle to obtain. The Cardinal,
however, quite declined to approach the King on the
subject, and told the Duchess that a rupture with
Denmark would make him more unpopular in Flanders
than he was already, saying that he had no wish to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>stoned by the Dutch. Before leaving Nancy he discussed
the situation at length with the Duchess's
latest friend, Baron de Polweiler, the Bailiff of
Hagenau, a brave and loyal servant of Charles V.,
who had warmly espoused Christina's cause and
was in correspondence with the Danish malcontents.
The Baron was a wise and practical man, and agreed
with Granvelle that the best course of action would
be to keep up the agitation in Denmark, without
taking further measures until the coming of King
Philip, which was now confidently expected.<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1564</span>] ILLNESS OF CHRISTINA</div>

<p>After the Cardinal's departure, Christina fell ill at
Den&#339;uvre, and was unable to accompany the Duke,
who came to fetch her, and insisted on putting
off the child's christening until his mother was fit
to travel. At length, on the 2nd of May, the
Duchess and her daughters started for Bar, where the
christening was celebrated on the following day, and
Christina held her grandson at the font. There was
no display of armed force, nor was any attempt made
to introduce Lutheran rites. On the contrary, the
Queen-mother and all her suite were most amiable,
the greatest good-will prevailed on all sides, and the
whole party spent the next week in feasting, jousting,
and dancing, while Ronsard composed songs in honour
of the occasion. On the 9th of May the young King
resumed his progress to Lyons, and the aged Duchess
Antoinette, who had come to Bar at the Cardinal of
Lorraine's prayer, returned to Joinville with her son.
Christina's worst alarms had been dispelled, but
her suspicions were to some extent justified by the
revival of the French King's old claims to Bar, and
the advance of certain new pretensions, which were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>eventually referred to a court of justice in Paris.
What annoyed her scarcely less was the inferior
quality of the ring sent by the King of Spain to
Duchess Claude, which excited more than one unpleasant
comment, although Count Mansfeldt, who
stood proxy for Philip, informed her privately that
Margaret of Parma had spent double the sum named
by His Majesty on his christening present.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>


<h3>IV.</h3>

<p>In July, 1564, Christina fell dangerously ill, and
Silliers told Polweiler that his mistress was suffering
from a grave internal malady. In November she
had a severe relapse, and her death was hourly expected.
Her children and servants nursed her
with untiring devotion, and her friends at Brussels
were deeply concerned. Anne d'Aerschot, Margaret
d'Aremberg, Egmont, and the Prince of Orange, made
frequent inquiries; and even Queen Mary wrote from
Scotland to ask after the Duchess's health. Philip
alone took no notice of her illness, and his indifference
was keenly resented by Christina and her whole
family. "For the love of God," wrote Silliers to
Polweiler, "do your best to see that Madame is consoled,
or she will certainly die of grief and despair."
And he poured out a passionate complaint, setting
forth his mistress's wrongs, and saying how, after
cheating her out of Vigevano, the King kept both the
castle and revenues of her dower city in his hands,
and allowed her subjects to be exposed to the depredations
of the Spanish garrison. "To my mind," he
adds, "this is a strange proof of the singular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
affection which he professes to have for my Lady!"<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
Granvelle himself was much concerned, and, when
Polweiler wrote to report an improvement in the
Duchess's condition, expressed his thankfulness, saying
that the loss of such a Princess would be a heavy
blow to the cause of religion, as well as the greatest
calamity that could befall Lorraine. He owned that
Madame had been harshly treated, and could only
counsel patience and assure her of Philip's good-will;
but he confessed that the task was a disagreeable one.
When Philip wrote at last, it was merely to exhort
the Duchess to be patient, as the whole world was
in travail, and to promise that her claims should be
settled by the Cardinal.<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> Meanwhile fresh appeals
reached Christina every day from her Danish partisans,
while King Eric of Sweden, who had declared
war on Denmark, opened negotiations with her
through his French Minister, Charles de Mornay. A
marriage between this young King and Ren&eacute;e was
proposed, and Eric offered to support the Duchess's
rights to Denmark if she could obtain the help of the
Emperor and of the Netherlands. Ferdinand, however,
quite declined to countenance any attack on his
ally, and begged his dear niece not to stir up strife in
Germany, although he assured her of his paternal
love and readiness to help her in the recovery of her
rights by peaceable methods. A few weeks after
writing this letter the good Emperor died, and, as
Christina knew, she could expect little from his successor
Maximilian, who had never forgiven her friendship
with Philip in bygone days, and did not even
send her the customary announcement of his father's
death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span></p><div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1565</span>] DUKE ADOLF'S MARRIAGE</div>

<p>Another ally whose help the Duchess tried to enlist
was the old Landgrave, Philip of Hesse, whose
daughter Christina, after being wooed for some years
by the King of Sweden, was finally married to Duke
Adolf of Holstein on the 20th of January, 1565. As
Granvelle remarks, it was a strange ending to this
Prince's long courtship of Madame de Lorraine, but
he probably still hoped to support her cause in
Denmark. And as the Prince of Orange was asked
to represent King Philip at the marriage, Christina
would have an opportunity of consulting him about
her Danish expedition.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> But the Prince refused to
leave Flanders, and a serious relapse prevented the
Duchess from attending the wedding. As soon as
she had recovered sufficiently, Christina dictated a
letter to her beloved sister Anne, who was still her
most faithful friend:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Your letter was most welcome, as I had not heard
from you lately, and I thank you warmly for all that
you say. I am getting better, but am not very strong
yet. As to the Swedish business, I am anxious to
know the name of the person whom you mention as
having the greatest affection for me and mine, and
who might help me with the King. And as I know
that you only desire my good, I beg you to keep your
eyes open, and tell me who are my best friends at
Court. I quite agree with you that it is useless
to fish in troubled waters. Monsieur d'Egmont's
journey to Spain is a surprising event! The cause is
unknown to me, but it must be some matter of importance.
Thank you again with all my heart for
the love that is expressed in your letters."<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a></p></div>

<p>The friends to whose influence at Court Anne had
referred were the Count and Countess of Aremberg,
who stood high in favour with the King and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>Regent, and were in constant correspondence with
Christina.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Would to God," wrote Margaret of Aremberg,
"that Madame de Lorraine could obtain the King's
favour! She would then be easily able to regain her
own, as the Danes hate their King, and he has no
power over them. But I confess I have lost all hopes
of this ever coming to pass."<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1565</span>] JOURNEY TO BRUSSELS</div>

<p>By the advice of these friends, the Duchess now
decided to send Baron de Polweiler to Spain to beg
the King for the 300,000 crowns due to her, in order
that she might avail herself of the opportunity presented
by the war between Sweden and Denmark,
and open the campaign in the summer. Upon this
Granvelle felt it his duty to inform his master of the
Duchess's plans, which might, he thought, be successful
if the King could help her with subsidies, since she
had several allies in Germany.<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> Duke Eric of Brunswick
offered to raise an army and take the command
of the expedition, and the Landgrave of Hesse
promised to help on condition that she gave her
daughter Ren&eacute;e in marriage to one of his sons; while,
by way of removing Philip's objections, the Cardinal
dwelt on the advantages of restoring the true faith in
these Northern kingdoms. But this plan was frustrated
by the Archduke Ferdinand's refusal to give
Polweiler leave of absence, and as Silliers, who offered
to go in his stead, would only have made matters
worse, Christina resolved to ask Count Egmont to
plead her cause at Madrid. Even Granvelle, who had
no love for the Count, approved of this plan. Egmont
was known to be devoted to the Duchess, and his great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>popularity in the Low Countries would go far to
remove the objections to a breach with Denmark in
those provinces. Unfortunately, in spite of his good-will,
Egmont effected no more for Christina than he
did for the liberties of the Netherlands. He was
royally entertained by Philip and his courtiers, and
loaded with presents and flatteries, but, when he
came to business, received nothing but vague words
and empty promises.</p>

<p>On his return to Flanders in April, his house was
crowded with visitors, and the Duchess, finding that
she could obtain no answer to her letters, determined
to go to Brussels herself. In June she set out on her
journey, saying that she was going to kiss the Holy
Coat at Treves and pay her devotions to the Blessed
Sacrament of the Miracle at Brussels, in fulfilment of
a vow made when she had been at the point of death.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a>
Her pilgrimage excited great curiosity, and even
Polweiler was in the dark as to its object, but felt
convinced that she meant to see Egmont and Eric of
Brunswick, and that they would soon hear of a sudden
call to arms.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I hear from a trustworthy source," wrote the
Landgrave to Louis of Nassau, "that the old Duchess
of Lorraine is going to Brussels with both her
daughters. She has raised 400,000 crowns at Antwerp
to make war on Denmark, and is to be helped
by the Netherlands with ships, money, and men. Her
daughter Ren&eacute;e is to marry King Eric, and a close
alliance against the Danish King is to be formed
between Sweden, Lorraine, the States, and the Holy
Empire. Although I do not hold popular rumours
to be as infallible as Holy Gospel, I count them more
worthy of belief than &AElig;sop's fables or the tales of
Amadis de Gaul. Of one thing I am quite sure: The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>Duchess does not travel to Flanders or send an Ambassador
to Sweden to roast pears or dance a galliard.
The latest report is that the Duchess is going to sell
her claims on Denmark to the King of Spain, but I can
hardly think His Majesty will be anxious to buy
these barren rights which bring a war in their train.
Do not take my gossip unkindly, but let me know
what you hear of this business."<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p></div>

<p>A cloud of mystery surrounds this visit which
Christina paid to Brussels in the summer of 1565.
She declined the Regent's invitation to occupy her
old quarters in the palace, but stayed in the religious
house known as the Cloister of Jericho, and afterwards
with the Duchess of Aerschot at Diest. She
received visits from Duke Eric, who professed himself
ready to raise troops to serve her at the shortest
notice, and also from Count Egmont. But all that
she could learn from this noble was that, when he
urged her claims on the King, and begged him to see
that the arrears due to her were paid, Philip replied
that Her Highness was the wisest and most virtuous
of women, and would always take the best course
possible.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> By August Christina was back in Lorraine,
and attended the christening of Nicholas de Vaudemont's
new-born daughter, who received the name
of Christina.<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1566</span>] INTRIGUES WITH SWEDEN</div>

<p>Whatever others may have felt about the Duchess's
designs on Denmark, the King of Sweden was evidently
in earnest. Four Ambassadors arrived at
Nancy on All Saints' Day, 1565, and went on to
Den&#339;uvre. They brought offers from Eric to conquer
Norway and Denmark in the Duchess's name
and leave her in possession of the latter kingdom, and
asked for Madame Ren&eacute;e's hand, in order to confirm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>the alliance between Lorraine and Sweden. During
a whole year the Swedish Envoys remained at Nancy,
and prolonged conferences were held between them
and the Duke and his mother. A new ally also came
to her help in the person of the Czar of Muscovy, who
was profuse in his offers of assistance. Christina's
hopes rose high, and a medal was struck in 1566, bearing
her effigy as Queen of Denmark, with the motto:
<i>Me sine cuncta ruunt</i> (Without me all things
perish).<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> But one ally after the other failed her.
Both the Emperor Maximilian and the Elector of
Saxony, who had married a Princess of Denmark,
were strongly opposed to her schemes; while the
ancient feud between the Danes and Swedes, who, in
Silliers's words, "hated each other as much as cats
and dogs or English and French," helped to complicate
matters.<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a> At the same time, she felt reluctant
to give her daughter to a man of Eric's unstable
character, who had been courting Queen Elizabeth
and Christina of Hesse at the same time, and was
known to have a low-born mistress. She had good
reason to be afraid that the story of King Christian
and Dyveke might be repeated, and her fears were
justified when, a year later, the King of Sweden raised
this favourite to the throne, and was soon afterwards
deposed by his subjects. The defection of Peder Oxe,
who made his peace with the King of Denmark and
returned to Copenhagen at the close of 1566, was
another blow, and the ultimate defeat of the Swedes
in the following year extinguished her last hopes.<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a>
Cardinal Granvelle, who had been sent to Italy by
Philip to keep him away from the Netherlands, wrote
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span>that the Viceroy, with the best will in the world,
found it impossible to pay the arrears due to the
Duchess, and could not withdraw the garrison at
Tortona without the King's leave. As for the Danish
expedition, Granvelle told Polweiler that it was more
hopeless than ever, and he could only advise Her
Highness to abandon the idea.<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Madame de Lorraine," replied the Baron, "is in
great perplexity, abandoned by all her relatives, and,
like Tantalus, is left to die of thirst, looking down on
a clear and beautiful stream."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">March, 1567</span>] LES GUEUX</div>

<p>But a few faithful friends were still left. In May,
1566, the Duchess of Aerschot came to Lorraine with
her young son, and spent the summer in her old home.
The troubles in the Netherlands filled her with the
utmost anxiety, and her family, like many others,
was divided. All her own sympathies were with
William of Orange and Egmont in the struggle for
freedom, but her stepson, Philip of Aerschot, and her
cousin, Count d'Aremberg, were among the few nobles
who refused to join the League, and stood fast by
the Regent. Margaret of Parma looked coldly on her,
owing to Anne's connection with Christina and the
Prince of Orange, and did not even send her an invitation
to her son Alexander's wedding. With her
wonted good sense, Anne refused to notice this affront,
and told her friends that she was too unwell to attend
the festivities, which excited much discontent by their
profuse extravagance.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> But the situation was painful,
and she was glad to retire to Lorraine and enjoy the
company of Christina and her venerable aunt, Duchess
Antoinette. Together they read the affectionate letters
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>which Mary Stuart wrote from her Northern home,
and sighed over the perils surrounding the young
Queen. In spite of her relatives' advice, she had
married Darnley, the handsome Scottish boy whom
her uncle the Cardinal of Lorraine termed "that
great nincompoop of a girl," and was already learning
to her cost the mistake that she had made.</p>

<p>Terrible news now came from Flanders. Riots
broke out in Antwerp and Ghent, and spread rapidly
through the provinces. The great church of St. John
was plundered, Hubert van Eyck's famous Adoration
was only saved by the presence of mind of the
Canons, and the tomb of Christina's mother, Queen
Isabella, was hacked to pieces.<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> In Brussels S.
Gudule was stripped of its pictures and statues, and
the cry of "Vivent les Gueux!" rang through the
courts of Charles V.'s palace. The Regent tried in
vain to escape, and was forced to turn for help to the
Prince of Orange and her most bitter enemies. Anne
returned home to find public affairs in dire confusion,
and retired to her dower-house at Diest. After her
departure Christina became seriously ill, and in the
spring of 1567 her daughters entreated the Countess
of Aremberg to come to Lorraine, saying that her
presence would be the best medicine for their mother.
Margaret obeyed the summons and spent three
months at Nancy and Den&#339;uvre.<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> On her return she
told Granvelle's friend, Provost Morillon, that the
King made a great mistake in being so unfriendly
to the House of Lorraine, and that if Madame died
the Duke would become altogether French, and his
duchy might at any moment fall into the hands of
France. Charles was Catholic to his finger-tips, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>entirely devoted to his mother, but after her death
no one could tell what might happen.<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> These representations
were not without effect. Philip wrote in
a more kindly strain to the Duchess, and sent one of
his Chamberlains&mdash;Don Luis de Mendoza&mdash;to wait
upon her at Nancy, and remain in Lorraine until the
arrival of the Duke of Alva, who was now despatched
from Spain to replace Margaret of Parma as Captain-General
of the Netherlands. In July he crossed the
Mont Cenis, and marched through Lorraine at the
head of a force of picked Spanish and Italian soldiers.
Brant&ocirc;me rushed to Nancy to see this "gentle and
gallant army," with their fine new muskets and pikes,
but the sight filled many of the spectators with profound
misgivings.<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1568</span>] DEATH OF EGMONT</div>

<p>The Prince of Orange had already resigned all his
offices and retired to Germany, but Egmont and his
friend Count Horn were caught in the fatal snare, and
were both arrested at a banquet in Alva's house on
the evening of the 9th of September. The news filled
Europe with consternation. In her distress Christina
wrote several letters to the King of Spain, pleading
passionately for the Count's release, and recalling his
great deeds and the devotion which he had always
shown to the King's service.<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> Her appeals were
seconded by the Duke and his wife, by Vaudemont,&mdash;Egmont's
own brother-in-law&mdash;by the Duke and
Duchess of Bavaria, the Elector Palatine, and all the
Princes of the Empire. Maximilian himself addressed
two autograph letters to Philip, praying for the Count's
release, and the Knights of the Golden Fleece protested
against this violation of the rules of their Order.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>But all was in vain. Philip vouchsafed no answer
to any of these appeals, saying he would not change
his mind if the sky were to fall on his head,<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> and on
the 6th of June, 1568, the Grande Place witnessed
the execution of the hero of Gravelines. A fortnight
before this shocking event, Anne, Duchess of Aerschot,
breathed her last at Diest, thankful to escape from a
world so full of misery, and only grieving to think that
her vast dower and fine estates would not pass to their
rightful owner, William of Orange.<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> In the same
month of May the first battle was fought between
the revolted nobles and the Spanish forces, and
Margaret of Aremberg's husband fell fighting valiantly
in the m&ecirc;l&eacute;e. Meanwhile civil war had broken out
again in France, and in November, 1567, the Constable
Montmorency, the old Nestor of France, was killed in
a battle at St. Denis, fighting against the Huguenots,
with Cond&eacute; and his own nephew Coligny at their head.
Old friends were falling on every side, and before
Christina's tears for her sister-in-law were dried, she and
the aged Duchess of Guise were mourning the sad fate
of Antoinette's luckless granddaughter, the Queen of
Scots, who had been compelled to abdicate her throne,
and was now a captive in the hands of her rival, Queen
Elizabeth.</p>


<h3>V.</h3>

<p>While civil war was raging all round, and Christina's
best friends were dying on the scaffold or the battle-field,
the marriage of her daughter Ren&eacute;e brought a
ray of light into her life. The tale of Ren&eacute;e's courtships
almost rivals that of her mother's. The Kings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>of Sweden and Denmark, William of Orange and
Henri de Joinville, were only a few among the candidates
who sought her hand. Granvelle once proposed
the Duke of Urbino as a suitable match, and
Philip was anxious to marry her to his handsome and
popular half-brother, Don John of Austria. But
the Duchess declined this offer repeatedly, saying
that no child of hers should ever wed a bastard.
When in the summer of 1567, Don Luis de Mendoza
again urged this suit on the King's behalf, the Duchess
informed him that her daughter's hand was already
promised to Duke William of Bavaria, the eldest son
of the reigning Duke Albert and his wife, the Archduchess
Anna. The contract was signed in September,
and the marriage took place early in the following
year,<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> and turned out very happily. Throughout his
life the Bavarian Duke maintained worthily the strong
Catholic traditions of his house, and proved a dutiful
and affectionate son-in-law. Christina spent the
following winter at the Castle of Friedberg in Bavaria,
where she was once more dangerously ill, and Silliers
as usual complained bitterly of Philip's neglect and
unkindness in never making inquiries after her health.
But, in spite of all rebuffs, neither the Baron nor his
mistress had abandoned their dreams of conquering
Denmark, and in April, 1569, Cardinal Granvelle
wrote to the King from Rome:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1572</span>] DEATH OF SILLIERS</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"Madame de Lorraine is still trying to recover her
father's kingdom, and both she and her Councillor,
Silliers, are continually begging me for help in this
matter. In vain I have replied for the hundredth
time that I am too far from Madrid and the Low
Countries to know if the affair is practicable, and have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>pointed out that, in the first place, the Dutch will
never break with Denmark; secondly, that the
Emperor would object to any attempt of this kind;
and, thirdly, that Your Majesty's hands are full. In
fact, I have told her that I cannot see any solid
foundations for her hopes. But she returns to the
charge again and again."<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a></p></div>

<p>It was the last flicker of an expiring flame. After
this, even Christina seems to have recognized the
futility of her schemes, and the death of Silliers finally
decided her to abandon them altogether. This "vain,
insupportable, and foolish man," as the Cardinal
called him, and whom her son, the Duke, also detested
cordially, lost his life in Bavaria, in September, 1572,
being killed by a shot from a crossbow, which was
said to be accidental, but which Granvelle and his
other enemies ascribed to a paid assassin.<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> During
the last twenty years, it must be owned, Silliers had
been the Duchess's evil genius; but, in spite of all
his faults, he was sincerely attached to his mistress,
and his devotion to her interests cannot be questioned.</p>

<p>Christina spent the next six years chiefly at Nancy
or Den&#339;uvre, in the company of her children and
grandchildren. The Duke had a large family of
three sons and six daughters, the eldest of whom,
Christina, bore a strong likeness to her grandmother
both in face and character. This Princess and her
cousin Louise de Vaudemont, the daughter of Nicholas
by his first wife, Margaret of Egmont, were great
favourites with the Duchess-mother, and spent much
time in her society. Louise was a fair and gentle
maiden, whose charms captivated Henry, Duke of
Anjou, when he came to Lorraine in 1573, on his way
to take possession of the throne of Poland. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>accompanied by his mother, Queen Catherine, who
spent a week at Nancy, and after her son's departure
remained some days at Blamont with Christina.
When, two years later, Henry succeeded his brother,
Charles IX., the new King's first thought was to make
the Princess of Lorraine his wife. Christina was too
ill to leave her bed, but Duchess Antoinette, still
young in spite of her eighty years, brought the bride
to Reims, where the wedding was celebrated two
days after Henry III.'s coronation. The Duke and
his sister Dorothea were present at the ceremony, as
well as all the Guise Princes.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> Five days afterwards,
on the 20th of February, 1575, the Duchess Claude,
whose health had long been failing, and who had
lately given birth to twin daughters, died in the ducal
palace, at the age of twenty-eight, leaving the Duke
an inconsolable widower. He was only thirty-two, and
although he lived till 1608, never married again. Soon
after Claude's death, her eldest daughter, Christina,
went to live with her grandmother, Catherine de'
Medici, at the French Court. This masterful lady,
who quarrelled with her own daughter Margaret, was
very fond of Christina, and kept this young Princess
constantly at her side during the next fourteen years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1575</span>] MARRIAGE OF DOROTHEA</div>

<p>In the following December, Elizabeth of Austria,
the widow of Charles IX., and daughter of the Emperor
Maximilian II., visited Nancy on her way back
to Vienna, and was escorted on her journey by Ren&eacute;e
and her husband, the Duke of Bavaria. They were
all three present at the wedding of the Princess
Dorothea, who was married in the Church of St.
Georges, on the 26th of December, to Duke Eric of
Brunswick.<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> This wild and restless Prince had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>always been on friendly terms with Christina and her
family, and was one of King Philip's favourite captains
and a Knight of the Golden Fleece. He had
lately lost his first wife, and succeeded his father in the
principalities of G&ouml;ttingen and Calenberg, although
his roving tastes made him prefer foreign service to
residence on his own estates. Now, at the age of
forty-seven, he became the husband of Christina's
younger daughter. In spite of her lameness, this
Princess inherited much of her aunt Dorothea's
charm and gaiety, and was fondly beloved by her
brother and all his children. She took especial
interest in the improvements which the Duke was
never tired of making at Nancy, and helped him in
laying out the beautiful terraced gardens, adorned
with fountains and orangeries, in the precincts of the
ducal palace. And the bell in the new clock-tower,
which the Duke built in 1577, was named Dorothea,
after the Duchess of Brunswick.<a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Charles himself,
like his father, was a Prince of cultured tastes, who
studied the Latin and Italian poets and took delight in
Ronsard's verses. The foundation of the University
at Pont-&agrave;-Mousson bore witness to his love of learning,
while he employed scholars to collect precious books
and manuscripts, and sent his gardeners to inspect
the royal palaces at Fontainebleau and St. Germain,
and to bring back rare plants and exotics.<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p>

<p>In these last years of Christina's life at Nancy, new
hopes and interests were suddenly brought into her
life by Don John of Austria's arrival in the Low
Countries. When terrorism and massacre had failed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>to crush the revolted provinces, the hero of Lepanto was
appointed Governor, in the hope that he might succeed
in restoring order, by appealing to his illustrious father's
memory and ruling the Netherlands according to his
example. In October, 1576, Don John travelled
through France in the disguise of a Moorish servant,
and, after spending one night in Paris, came to Joinville
to consult the Duke of Guise on a romantic scheme
which he had formed to release and marry the captive
Queen of Scots. Then he hurried on to Luxembourg
and proclaimed his intention of withdrawing the
Spanish troops and granting a general amnesty. The
coming of this chivalrous Prince, with his message
of peace, filled the people of the Netherlands with
new hope. Don John was received with open arms
by the Duke of Aerschot and his half-brother, Anne
of Lorraine's son, Charles de Croy, Marquis of Havr&eacute;.
His first act was to restore the lands and fortune of
the late Count Egmont to his widow, the Countess
Palatine Sabina, and her innocent children. This
rejoiced the heart of Madame d'Aremberg, who had
been spending the winter at Nancy with the Duchess,
and Christina's nephew, Charles de Croy, told Don
John frankly that the Low Countries would gladly
have him, not only for their Governor, but for their
King. Christina herself was deeply stirred, and sent
a member of her household to Luxembourg with
a letter welcoming the Prince in the warmest terms,
and thanking him for the cheering news which he
had sent her.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Nov., 1576</span>] DON JOHN OF AUSTRIA</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I can only praise God," she wrote, "for your
appointment to the government of the Low Countries,
and trust that the same success that, thanks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>to your great valour and prudence, has everywhere
attended you will continue to crown your efforts.</p>

<p class="right">
"Your very loving and more than<br />

"<span class="smcap">Chr&eacute;tienne</span>.</p>
<p>
"Blamont, November 12, 1576."<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a><br />
</p>
</div>

<p>In her anxiety to see Don John, the Duchess set
out for Pont-&agrave;-Mousson; but when she reached Nancy,
on the 12th of December, she heard that the Prince
had already left Luxembourg for the Netherlands,
and sent him the following letter by a confidential
servant, who was to tell him many things which she
could not commit to paper:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>

"<span class="smcap">My Cousin</span>,<br />
</p>

<p>"The singular wish that I have to see Your
Highness, and confer with you on many points of the
highest importance, induced me to leave Blamont
and come to Pont-&agrave;-Mousson, in order to be near you
and to have an opportunity of seeing you and conversing
together, as you will learn more fully from
this gentleman whom I am sending to wish you all
prosperity and success in your noble designs and
enterprises, as well as to tell you many things which
I beg you to hear and believe."<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a></p></div>

<p>Don John replied in the same friendly spirit, telling
her his plans and thanking her most warmly for her
advice.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"As for me," he wrote, "I am exceedingly obliged
to Your Highness for your offers, and shall always
be most grateful for your advice and help, knowing,
Madame, your great experience and wisdom in affairs.
God knows how anxious I was to come and see Your
Highness on my journey here, and kiss your hands,
but it was impossible owing to the urgency of affairs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>requiring my presence here. I am very glad indeed,"
he adds in a postscript, "to hear that you are in good
health."<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a></p></div>

<p>The Prince was evidently impressed by the soundness
of the Duchess's judgment and by her great
popularity in the Netherlands, for when, a few weeks
later, he began to realize the hopeless nature of his
task, and begged for his recall, he repeatedly told
Philip that, in his opinion, the Duchess of Lorraine
would be the best person to take his place.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duchess of Lorraine," he wrote on February
16, 1577, "has all the qualities necessary for the
government of these provinces, which she would
administer far better than I can, because they are
beginning to hate me, and I know that I hate them."</p></div>

<p>Again, a little later:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I find in Madame de Lorraine a real desire to
serve Your Majesty. She has come to Pont-&agrave;-Mousson
to see if she can be of help to me, and I am
sure would gladly execute any orders that she may
receive."</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Oct., 1578</span>] DEATH OF DON JOHN</div>

<p>Christina heard with delight of Don John's joyous
entry into Brussels on May Day, and received with
deep thankfulness his letter informing her of the
departure of the hated Spanish troops. But these
high hopes were doomed to disappointment. The
war soon broke out again, and after Don John's
victory of Gembloux in January, 1578, Madame de
Lorraine was one of the first persons to whom he
announced the news by letter.<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> Both of the Duchess's
sons-in-law joined in supporting Don John, and in
May, 1578, the Duke of Brunswick brought a force
of 3,000 Germans to join him at Namur. Dorothea
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span>accompanied her husband, and was about to pay the
Prince a visit, when she received a message from
her brother Charles, informing her of their mother's
serious illness, and left hastily for Nancy.<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a></p>

<p>Five months afterwards a premature death closed
the brilliant adventurer's career, and Christina was
left to grieve over the tragic end of this Prince, of
whom so much had been expected.</p>

<h2>BOOK XIV<br />

THE LADY OF TORTONA<br />

1578-1590</h2>


<h3>I.</h3>

<p>The marriage of her last remaining daughter, and
the removal of her granddaughter to the French
Court, loosened the ties that bound the Duchess-mother
to Lorraine. The failure of the high hopes
which Don John's coming had aroused were a grievous
disappointment, and, after her dangerous attack of
illness in the spring of 1578, Christina decided to
follow her doctor's advice and seek a warmer climate.
Her thoughts naturally turned to her dower city of
Tortona, whose inhabitants still paid her allegiance,
in spite of Philip's invasion of her privileges. Since
the Spanish garrison still occupied the castle, the
magistrates begged her to inhabit the Communal
palace, and Christina, touched by their expressions
of loyalty and affection, resolved to accept the
offer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1578</span>] CHRISTINA RETURNS TO ITALY</div>

<p>Before settling at Tortona, however, she decided
to make a pilgrimage to Loreto, the shrine for which
the Lorraine Princes had always cherished especial
veneration. Early in August, 1578, she left Nancy
and travelled across the Alps, and through Savoy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
by the route which she had taken as a bride, nearly
half a century before. Her old friend, the Duchess
Margaret, whose marriage had been one of the
happiest results of the Treaty of C&acirc;teau-Cambr&eacute;sis,
had already been dead four years, and her lord of
the Iron-head was a confirmed invalid; but he sent
his son, Charles Emanuel, to meet the Duchess and
escort her to the citadel of Turin.</p>

<p>From Savoy, Christina proceeded to Milan, where
she arrived on the 20th of August, and was hospitably
entertained in the Castello by the Spanish Viceroy,
the Marquis d'Ayamonte.<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> Once more she drove in
her chariot through the streets where her coming had
been hailed by rejoicing multitudes, once more she
prayed by her husband's tomb in the Duomo and saw
Leonardo's Cenacolo in Le Grazie. Her old friends,
Count Massimiliano, the Trivulzi, and Dejanira, were
dead and gone, and at every step the ghosts of bygone
days rose up to haunt her memory. Then she
travelled on by slow stages to Loreto, on the Adriatic
shore, where she paid her vows at Our Lady's shrine,
and offered a massive gold heart set with pearls and
precious gems, to the admiration of future pilgrims.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a>
But the long journey had overtaxed her strength,
and when, on her return to Lombardy, she reached
Ripalta, she was too ill to go any farther. Here
she remained throughout the winter to recover from
her fatigues and give the citizens of Tortona time
to prepare for her reception.</p>

<p>At length, on the 17th of June, 1579, the Duchess
made her state entry into the city. The magistrates
met her at the gates with a stately baldacchino fringed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>with gold and silver, and escorted their Sovereign Lady
to the house of Bartolommeo Busseto, where she
alighted to partake of the banquet which had been
prepared. Afterwards the loyal citizens accompanied
her to the Palazzo Pubblico, halfway up the hill above
the town, which had been splendidly fitted up for her
occupation. The beauty of the view delighted the
Duchess as much as the enthusiastic warmth of her
reception, and the health-giving breezes of the Lombard
city proved even more beneficial than her
physicians had expected. "She came to our city of
Tortona a dying woman, and lived there in health and
comfort for more than ten years."<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> So wrote Niccol&ograve;
Montemerlo, the historian whose chronicles of Tortona
were published in 1618, when Christina had not
yet been dead thirty years. His contemporaries
joined with him in praising the Duchess's wise and
beneficial rule, the strictness with which she administered
justice, her liberality and benevolence.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"The Duchess Christina of Milan," wrote Campo of
Cremona in 1585, "celebrated for her beauty and
gracious manners, for her affability and generosity,
has lately come to spend her widowhood in the city
of Tortona, and lives there in great splendour, beloved
by all."<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">June, 1579</span>] THE LADY OF TORTONA</div>

<p>Christina's administrative powers found ample
scope in the government of the city, and under her
rule Tortona enjoyed a brief spell of peace and prosperity.
She reformed abuses, obtained the restitution
of lost privileges, and healed a long-standing feud
with the city of Ravenna. At her prayer, Pope
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>Gregory XIII. repealed a decree exacting a heavy fine
from every citizen of Tortona who entered Ravennese
territory, and friendly communications were restored
between the two cities. Before her coming, the Spanish
Viceroy had incurred great unpopularity by building
a new citadel on the heights occupied by the ancient
Duomo and episcopal palace, and converting these
into barracks and powder-magazines. In 1560 the
foundations of a new Cathedral were laid by Philip's
orders in the lower city, but this could not atone in
the eyes of the citizens for the desecration of the
venerated shrine founded by St. Innocent in the fourth
century, and adorned with priceless mosaics and
marbles. When, in 1609, the lofty campanile was
struck by lightning, and 400 barrels of gunpowder
stored in the nave exploded with terrific force, the
accident was regarded as a Divine judgment, and the
panic-stricken Spaniards joined in the solemn procession
that bore the relics of the martyrs from their old
resting-place to the new sanctuary.<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a></p>

<p>But if Christina could not atone for this indignity,
or deliver Tortona from the presence of the hated
Spaniards, she protected her subjects from their
outrages, and rigidly enforced the observance of the
law. Many were the petitions and remonstrances
on behalf of her own rights and those of the citizens
which she addressed to her dear and illustrious cousin,
Don Carlos of Aragon, Duke of Terranuova, who
reigned over the Milanese as Viceroy from 1583 to
1592. The Duchess was in frequent correspondence
with her children beyond the Alps, and many requests
for passes for horses which she is sending to
Lorraine and Bavaria, as well as for privileges for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
her Equerries, Signor Alfonso and Gaspare Visconti,
are to be found in the archives of Milan.<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Jan., 1585</span>] THE LAST PHASE</div>

<p>Many were the illustrious guests, remarks Montemerlo,
who came to visit the Duchess at Tortona. In
October, 1581, the Empress-Dowager Maria, widow
of Maximilian II., passed through Lombardy on her
return to Spain, and was received at Alessandria by
Madame de Lorraine. Together they drove through
streets hung with tapestries and adorned with triumphal
arches, until, after three days' festivities, they
went on to Tortona, and thence to Genoa. The
families of the old Milanese nobles who had remained
loyal to the House of Sforza welcomed Christina's
return to Lombardy with joy. The nephew and heir
of Count Massimiliano Stampa placed his superb
pleasure-house at Montecastello, in the fief of Soncino,
at her disposal, and named his eldest son Christian
in her honour. The Guaschi of Alessandria, the Counts
of Oria, the Trivulzi, the Somaglia and Visconti, vied
with each other in entertaining her sumptuously.<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a>
The saintly Archbishop of Milan, Carlo Borromeo,
visited her more than once, and the excellent Bishop
of Tortona, Cesare Gambara, sought her help and
advice in all that concerned the welfare of his people.
From the day when, hardly more than a child
herself, she begged Cardinal Caracciolo's protection
for the destitute ladies at Pavia, Christina always
cared for the poor and needy, and in her old age she
was busy with active works of mercy. One of her
last good actions was to send to Paris for Madame
Castellani, a daughter of her old friend the Princess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>of Macedonia, who was living in reduced circumstances
at the French Court, and bring her to Tortona to
spend the rest of her life in peace and comfort. So
she earned the love and gratitude of all around her,
and thousands blessed the good Duchess's name long
after she was dead.</p>


<h3>II.</h3>

<p>This last phase of Christina's life was on the whole
peaceful and happy. Brant&ocirc;me pitied this great
lady, a daughter of Kings and niece of Emperors,
and the rightful Queen of three kingdoms, who,
after reigning over Milan and Lorraine, was reduced
to hold her Court in an insignificant Lombard town,
and was known in her last years as "Madame de
Tortone."<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> But after her troubled life Christina was
grateful for the peace and repose which she found at
Tortona, and would have been perfectly content if it
had not been for the continual annoyances to which
she was exposed by Philip and his Ministers. From
the moment that she settled in her dower city, the
King began to dispute her right to its sovereignty,
and insisted that, since Tortona had been settled
upon her as an equivalent for the dower given her
"out of pure liberality" by the late Emperor, she
was bound to surrender her claims on payment of
the sum in full. Christina, on her part, maintained
with good reason that her claim to the city had never
before been questioned, and that it was settled on her
at her marriage, and belonged to her and her heirs of
the House of Lorraine in perpetuity. The assertion
of this claim roused Cardinal Granvelle to the highest
indignation. "So dangerous a thing," he wrote to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>Philip, "cannot possibly be allowed." But, as he
confessed, what made the situation awkward was that
Madame de Lorraine's claims were strongly supported,
not only by her son, Duke Charles, but by the Emperor
Rudolf, the Duke of Bavaria, the Archdukes Ferdinand
and Charles, and all the Princes of the Empire.<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> A
long wrangle ensued, which ended in a declaration on
the King's part that he would consent to Tortona
being retained by the Duchess for her life, and afterwards
held by her son-in-law and daughter, the Duke
and Duchess of Brunswick.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Dec., 1584</span>] DUKE ERIC'S DEATH</div>

<p>Dorothea and her husband were, in fact, the only
members of Christina's family for whom Philip showed
any regard. In 1578 Duke Eric was summoned to
Spain to join in the contemplated invasion of Portugal,
and served in the campaign led by Alva two years
later. Dorothea accompanied her husband, and spent
most of her time at Court. The King evidently liked
her, and when, after the successful termination of the
war, the Duke and Duchess came to take leave of
him at Madrid, Granvelle was desired to draw up a
secret convention by which Tortona and the revenues
were assigned to Eric in lieu of the yearly pension
allowed him. But Dorothea was not to be outwitted
by the Cardinal. She insisted, on the arrears
due to her husband being paid in full, and Philip
himself told Granvelle to see that two or three thousand
crowns of the Duke's salary were given to the
Duchess, since she was short of money, and this seemed
to him only reasonable. He also gave Dorothea two
fine horses, which she wished to send to her brother-in-law,
the Duke of Bavaria, and granted her a patent
for working certain gold-mines, which the Cardinal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>promised to forward either to her mother at Tortona,
or else to the care of the Prince of Orange in Germany.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a>
This last direction sounds strange, considering that
the famous ban against the Prince, setting a price of
30,000 crowns on his head, had already been issued
at Granvelle's suggestion.<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a></p>

<p>The Duke and Duchess now returned to G&ouml;ttingen,
after visiting Christina at Tortona, and remained in
their own dominions for the next few years, among
their long-neglected subjects. But Eric soon became
restless, and in April, 1582, Dorothea wrote to beg
Granvelle's help in obtaining the Viceroyalty of Milan
or Naples for her husband. The Cardinal promised
to do his best, and two years later actually recommended
the Duke for the Viceroyalty of Sicily. But
a few weeks afterwards, on the 15th of December,
1584, Eric of Brunswick died at Pavia, and was buried
in the crypt of Bramante's church of S. Maria
Canepanova, where his tomb is still to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a>
The Duke's death released Philip from his promise
regarding the succession of Tortona. But he had
already taken the law into his own hands.</p>

<p>In June, 1584, when Christina and her ladies were
enjoying the delights of the Marchese Stampa's
beautiful villa at Montecastello, the Viceroy suddenly
appeared on the scene, and presented her with two
letters from His Catholic Majesty. These were to
inform her that, after long and mature deliberation,
the King and his Council had come to the conclusion
that her rights to the sovereignty of Tortona were
extinct, and reverted to him as Duke of Milan. But
since Madame de Lorraine was closely bound to him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>by ties of blood, and still more by the singular affection
which he had always borne her, His Majesty
was pleased to allow her to retain the enjoyment of
Tortona and its revenues for the remainder of her
life, which he hoped would be long and prosperous.
In vain Christina protested that her dowry had never
been paid, and that this city was granted to her in its
stead by the terms of her marriage contract. The
Viceroy replied in the most courteous language that
Madame was no doubt right, but that this was not
his affair, and he could only recommend that on this
point her claims should be referred to the Treasury.<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a>
He then proceeded to take possession of Tortona in
the King's name, and hoisted the Spanish standard
on the citadel and the Duchess's palace. Christina
could only bow to superior force, but she forwarded
a protest to the Catholic King and his Council, both
of whom refused to receive it, on the flimsy pretext
that the writer assumed the title of Queen of Denmark,
which they could not recognize. Certainly,
as Brant&ocirc;me remarked, and as Polweiler and Silliers
often complained, Philip showed his great affection
for his cousin in a strange manner.<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Sept., 1586</span>] DEATH OF GRANVELLE</div>

<p>Before the Duchess left Montecastello, she received
the news of the Prince of Orange's assassination at
Delft on the 10th of July, 1584. The hero and patriot
had fallen a victim to the plots of Philip and Granvelle,
and had paid the price with his life. Three
years afterwards Christina shared in the thrill of horror
that ran through Europe when Mary, Queen of Scots,
died on the scaffold. In that hour she could only be
thankful that the good old Duchess Antoinette was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>spared this terrible blow, and had died four years
before, at the advanced age of eighty-nine. To the
last Antoinette kept up friendly relations with her
niece, and in a letter written with her own hand in
November, 1575, the venerable lady expressed her
sincere regret that owing to her great age she was
unable to welcome Christina in person on her return
to Nancy, but that in the spring she quite hoped to
come and see her once more before she died.<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a></p>

<p>In 1586 Christina's old rival, Margaret of Parma,
and this Princess's stanch supporter, Cardinal Granvelle,
both died. Friends and foes were falling all
around, and young and old alike were passing out of
sight. But the Duchess still enjoyed fair health and
was so happy at Tortona that she often said she never
wished to leave home. As a rule, however, she spent
the summer months at the Rocca di Sparaviera, in
the mountains of Monferrato, "more," writes the
chronicler, "to please others than herself."<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> Each
year she obtained permission from the Viceroy to
send 250 sacks of wheat, free of duty, for the use of
her household to the Rocca, and her <i>maggiordomo</i>
went beforehand to prepare the rooms for her arrival.<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a>
The presence of the Duchess Dorothea, who joined
her mother at Tortona after the Duke of Brunswick's
death, was a great solace in these last
years, and consoled Christina for many losses and
sorrows.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the war of the League had broken out in
France, and the three Henries were contending for
the mastery. Since Henry III. was childless, Catherine
now tried to put forward the claims of a fourth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>Henry, the eldest son of her daughter Claude and the
Duke of Lorraine, and a party in France maintained
his claims to be at least as valid as those which
Philip II. advanced in virtue of his wife Elizabeth.
Christina's heart was moved at the thought of her
grandson succeeding to the throne of France, and in
1587 she sent a Lorraine gentleman, De Villers, to
Rome to beg the Pope for his support in this holy
cause. The Pope, however, merely replied that he
advised the Duke to live at peace with his neighbours.
The Duchess, nothing daunted, sent De Villers to
Nancy with letters bidding her son be of good cheer
and persevere in his great enterprise. Unfortunately,
the messenger fell into the hands of Huguenot soldiers,
who took him into the King of Navarre's camp. All
that could be found on him was an almost illegible
letter from Her Highness the Duke's mother, containing
these words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>"I am very glad to hear of the present state of your
affairs, and hope that you will go on and prosper, for
never was there so fine a chance of placing the crown
upon your head and the sceptre in your hand."<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p></div>

<p>The B&eacute;arnais smiled as he read this characteristic
effusion, and bade his soldiers let the man go free.
Charles, on his part, expressed considerable annoyance
at his mother's intervention, which only aroused
the suspicions of King Henry III., and made him
look coldly on his brother-in-law. The Duchess's
last illusion, however, was soon dispelled, and after the
murder of the Guise brothers at Blois, and the assassination
of the last Valois, Henry of Navarre was recognized
as King by the greater part of France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Feb., 1589</span>] AN INTERESTING MARRIAGE</div>

<p>Christina did not live to see the end of the civil war,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>and the union of Henri Quatre's sister with her own
grandson. But the last year of her life was cheered
by the marriage of her granddaughter Christina with
the Grand-Duke Ferdinand of Tuscany. Several
alliances had been proposed for this Princess since
she had gone to live at the French Court with her
grandmother. Catherine was very anxious to marry
her to Charles Emanuel, who in 1580 succeeded his
father as Duke of Savoy; but Spanish influences prevailed,
and the young Prince took the Infanta
Catherine for his wife.<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> In 1583 the Queen-mother
planned another marriage for her granddaughter, with
her youngest son, the Duke of Alen&ccedil;on, who had left
the Netherlands and lost all hope of winning Queen
Elizabeth's hand; but, fortunately for Christina, the
death of this worthless Prince in the following June
put an end to the scheme.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a> When, in October, 1586,
the King of Navarre divorced his wife Margot, Catherine
proposed that her son-in-law should marry her
granddaughter; but this plan fell through, as Henry
refused to abjure the Huguenot religion. On the
death of the Grand-Duke Francis in 1587, his brother
Ferdinand exchanged a Cardinal's hat for the ducal
crown, and made proposals of marriage to the Princess
of Lorraine. Catherine was overjoyed at the
thought of her beloved Christina reigning in Florence,
the home of her ancestors, and promised her granddaughter
a dowry of 600,000 crowns, with all her
rights on the Medici estates in Florence, including the
palace of the Via Larga. Orazio Rucellai was sent to
France to draw up the contract, which Bassompierre
signed on the Duke of Lorraine's part, on the 20th of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>October, 1588.<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> But the state of the country was so
unsettled that the Queen would not allow her granddaughter
to travel, and the fleet which sailed to fetch
the bride was detained for months in the port of
Marseilles. The murder of the Duke of Guise at Blois
in December threw the whole Court into confusion,
and a fortnight later Catherine herself died, on the
5th of January, 1589. It was not till the 25th of
February that the marriage was finally celebrated at
Blois. In March the bride set out on her journey,
attended by a brilliant company of French and
Florentine courtiers. Dorothea of Brunswick came
to meet her niece at Lyons, and accompanied her to
Marseilles, where Don Pietro de' Medici awaited her
with his Tuscan galleys, and on the 23rd of April
Christina at length landed at Leghorn. Ferdinand
met his bride at the villa of Poggio a Caiano, and conducted
her in triumph to Florence.<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> When the prolonged
festivities were over, Monsieur de Lenoncourt,
whom Charles of Lorraine had sent to escort his
daughter to Florence, went on, by his master's orders,
to Tortona, "to kiss the hands of the Duke's mother,
the Queen of Denmark, and receive her commands."<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">Aug., 1590</span>] DEATH OF CHRISTINA</div>

<p>Unlike her mother and grandmother, the Grand-Duchess
Christina enjoyed a long and prosperous
married life, and after her husband's death was
Regent during the minority of both her son and
grandson. There is an interesting triptych in the
Prado at Madrid, with portraits of the bride, her
mother and grandmother, painted by some Burgundian
artist at the time of the wedding. The
young Grand-Duchess, a tall, handsome girl of four-and-twenty,
wears a high lace ruff, with ropes of pearls
round her neck and a jewelled girdle at her waist.
She carries a fan in her hand, and the Medici <i>palle</i>
are emblazoned on her shield with the lilies of France
and the eagles of Lorraine. Her mother, the shortlived
Duchess Claude, bears a marked resemblance to
Catherine de' Medici, but is smaller and slighter in
build, and altogether of a gentler and feebler type.
She too holds a fan, and wears a gown of rich brocade
with bodice and sleeves thickly sown with pearls.
Christina, on the contrary, is clad in mourning robes,
and her white frilled cap and veil and plain cambric
ruff are without a single jewel. But the fine features
and noble presence reveal her high lineage. Instead
of a fan, she holds a parchment deed in her hand, and
on her shield the arms of Austria and Denmark are
quartered with those of Milan and Lorraine, while
above we read the proud list of her titles&mdash;Queen of
Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, Duchess of Milan,
Lorraine, Bar, and Calabria, and Lady of Tortona.</p>

<p>This was the last portrait of Christina that was
ever painted. In the following summer she went as
usual to the Rocca of Sparaviera with her daughter
Dorothea, to spend the hot days of August in the
hills. But she had not been there long before she
fell dangerously ill. In her anxiety to return home,
she took boat and travelled by water as far as Alessandria.
There she became too ill to go any farther,
and died on the 10th of August, 1590, in the house of
her friend Maddalena Guasco.<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p>

<p>The Duchess's corpse was borne by night to Tortona,
where a funeral service was held in the new Duomo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
after which the body was embalmed and taken by her
daughter Dorothea to Nancy. The news was sent to
King Philip in Spain, and he and his greedy Ministers
lost no time in laying hands on her city and revenues.
"We are informed," wrote the Viceroy to the
President of the Senate, two days after Christina's
death, "that Her Most Serene Highness Madame de
Lorraine has passed to a better life, and accordingly
we claim the pension of 4,000 crowns assigned to Her
late Highness, on the quarter of the Castello, and
enclose a list of the revenues of Tortona, which now
revert to the Duchy of Milan."<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a></p>


<h3>III.</h3>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="smcap">May, 1608</span>] DEATH OF CHARLES III.</div>

<p>The good citizens of Tortona were sorely distressed
when they learnt that the remains of their beloved
liege Lady were not to rest among them. But Christina's
heart was in Lorraine, and her children laid
her body in the crypt of the Cordeliers' church, in the
grave of the husband whom she had loved so faithfully
and so long. Twenty-one years later her ashes were
removed with those of Duke Francis and his parents,
Antoine and Ren&eacute;e, to the sumptuous chapel begun
by her son Charles in 1607, and completed by his successors.
The Rotonde, as it was called in Lorraine,
was built on the model of the Cappella dei Principi,
which the Duke's son-in-law, Ferdinand de' Medici,
had lately reared in Florence, and was dedicated to
Our Lady of Loreto. It was the work of a Tuscan
architect, Gianbattista Stabili, and of Jean Ligier
Richier, the son of the famous Lorraine sculptor, and
was lined throughout with rich marbles and adorned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_511" id="Page_511">[Pg 511]</a></span>with a mass of carving.<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> The cupola was added in
1632 by Simon Drouin, and the internal decorations
were only completed in 1743, by order of the
husband of Maria Theresa, afterwards the Emperor
Francis I. By this Prince's pious care Latin inscriptions
were placed over each sarcophagus, and the
following words were carved on the tomb of Christina
and her husband:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Christina's son, Charles III., died, after a long and
prosperous reign, on the 14th of May, 1608, and was
tenderly nursed during his last illness by his youngest
daughter, Catherine, and his sister Dorothea. After
her mother's death, the Duchess of Brunswick never
left Lorraine again, and became the wife of a Burgundian
noble, Marc de Rye, Marquis of Varembon.<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
She only survived her brother four years, and was
buried in the Jesuit church of St. Stanilas at Nancy.
Her remains and the heart of Duke Charles, which had
been interred in the same chapel, were removed to the
ducal mausoleum in 1772, when some fresh improvements
were made in the Rotonde, by order of Marie
Antoinette, the daughter of the last Duke of Lorraine
and of the Empress Maria Theresa.<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> At the
Revolution, in 1793, these tombs were destroyed and
their contents rifled by the mob, and the ashes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>dead Princes were flung into a common grave. In
1818 they were replaced in their original tombs, the
sarcophagi were restored, and the old inscriptions
once more carved in the marble.</p>

<p>Charles III.'s second daughter, Elizabeth, married
her first cousin, Maximilian, who succeeded his father
in 1598, as Duke of Bavaria, and played a memorable
part in the Thirty Years' War. Her next sister,
Antoinette, became Duchess of Cleves, while Catherine,
the youngest and most interesting of the whole
family, took the veil after her father's death. This
beautiful and accomplished Princess refused all the
suitors who sought her hand, among them the scholar-Emperor,
Rudolf II., who found in her a kindred
spirit. A mystic by nature, Catherine assumed the
grey Capucin habit while she lived at her father's
Court, and, after he died, founded a Capucin convent
in Nancy. The Pope appointed her Abbess of
Remiremont, a Benedictine community of high-born
ladies, which she endeavoured to reform. She was
much attached to her aunt Dorothea, and after her
death spent most of her time at the Court of France
with her niece Margaret, the wife of Gaston, Duke of
Orleans. Catherine took an active part in French
politics in the stormy days of Louis XIII., and died
in Paris in 1648, at the age of seventy-five.<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">1736] THE LAST DUKE OF LORRAINE</div>

<p>The seventeenth century witnessed the gradual dismemberment
of the duchy of Lorraine, and in Richelieu's
days Nancy was again occupied by French
invaders. At length, in 1736, the last Duke,
Francis III., was compelled to surrender Lorraine
in exchange for the grand-duchy of Tuscany, on his
marriage with Maria Theresa, the only child of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>Emperor Charles VI. From that time Lorraine
ceased to exist as an independent State, and became
a province of France, while the ex-King Stanislas
of Poland fixed his residence at Nancy and transformed
the ancient capital into a modern city. By
this marriage the House of Lorraine became merged
in the imperial line of Habsburg, and the blood of
King Ren&eacute; still flows in the veins of the Austrian
Emperor and of the royal families of Savoy and Spain.</p>

<p>Christina would have rejoiced to know that this
union&mdash;a love-match like her own&mdash;was followed
shortly by the elevation of Maria Theresa's husband
to the imperial throne, and that by this means the
House of Habsburg was raised to a height of power
and splendour which it had never attained since the
days of Charles V. For although she married twice
into princely houses, and was much attached both to
Milan and Lorraine, Christina was before all else
a Habsburg, and the glory and welfare of the imperial
race remained throughout her life the first object
of her thoughts. Like Mary of Hungary and Eleanor
of France, she grew up in absolute obedience to the
Emperor's will, and wherever she went in after-years
his word was still her law. In the darkest hours of
her life, when she lost son and State at one blow,
it was her greatest sorrow to feel that she could no
longer be of service to the Emperor and his house.
After the abdication of Charles V., this love and
loyalty were transferred to Philip II., and her one
fear was lest her son should be drawn into the opposite
camp, and become French in his sympathies.
And to the end she was always quick to obey the call
of blood and respond to any appeal from a member of
the House of Austria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span></p>

<p>This strong family affection gave an added bitterness
to the neglect and injustice which she suffered
at Philip's hands during the last thirty years of her
existence. One reason for his persistently harsh
usage was, there can be no doubt, that Christina
represented the national feeling and aspirations after
freedom, which Philip and his ministers, Alva and
Granvelle, did all in their power to crush. Both in
the Netherlands, where the popularity of the great
Emperor's niece made her dangerous in their eyes,
and in Lombardy, where she filled an important
position as Lady of Tortona, she came into collision
with the same all-reaching arm. To the last she
strove valiantly to resist the tyranny of Spanish
officials and to protect her subjects from the rapacity
of foreign soldiers, and a century after her death the
citizens of Tortona still cherished the memory of the
noble lady who, as long as she lived, had preserved
them from the yoke of Spain.</p>

<p>Christina's lot was cast in troubled times, when
crime and bloodshed were rife, and religious convictions
only served to heighten the violence of men's
passions; but her name shines pure and unsullied
on these dark pages of history. She was naturally
hasty and impulsive, she made some mistakes and
met with many failures, but she was always generous
and high-minded, faithful and affectionate to her
friends, and full of ardent charity for the poor and
downtrodden. Above all, her unceasing labours in
the cause of peace justly earned the gratitude of her
contemporaries, and deserve to be remembered by
posterity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">1590] CHRISTINA'S RARE CHARM</div>

<p>At the close of this long and eventful life we turn
back once more to Holbein's portrait of the youthful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span>
Duchess. As we look at the grave eyes and innocent
face, we ask ourselves what was the secret of this
woman's power, of the strange fascination which she
possessed for men and leaders of men. What made
heroes like Ren&eacute; of Orange, and daredevils like
Albert of Brandenburg, count the world well lost
for love of her? Why were brave captains and
brilliant courtiers&mdash;Stampa, Vend&ocirc;me, De Courri&egrave;res,
Polweiler, Adolf of Holstein&mdash;all of them her willing
slaves from the moment that they saw her face and
heard the sound of her voice? What drew thoughtful
men like William of Orange and Emanuel Philibert
into the circle of her intimate friends, and brought
even the cold-hearted Philip under her spell? It
was hardly her beauty, for she had many rivals, or
her superior intellect and exalted birth. Rather was
it the rare and indefinable quality that we call charm,
the sweet womanliness of nature, the gentle sympathy
and quick response of heart and eye, ready at
any moment to listen and to help, to comfort and to
cheer. This, if we mistake not, was the secret of
Christina's wonderful influence, of the attraction
which she possessed for men and women alike, an
attraction which outlived the days of youth and
endured to the last hour of her life. Ever loving, she
was therefore ever beloved.</p>

<p>Monsignore mio cordialissimo marito: Ho bene veduto voluntieri,
come sempre sono accostumata, le sue care littere del
20, ma di molto megliora voglia haveria voluto veder la presentia
sua, come speranza mi fu data di breve esser, et per
dire la vera verita ormai quelli Signori com&#772;inciano haver pu&igrave;
che torto. Pur mi voglio contentar di quello che la ragione
consiglia che si faci, et quella dimora che V. S. judicara esser
bene per tutti, lo havero anche io per accepto, ringratiandola
de le sue cortese excusationi per la tardezza del ritorno, ma
non savendogli gratia di quello che la mi scrive, ch'io n&#333;
prende pena di scriverli di mia mano, perch&egrave; questo e solo
ben speso tempo, et a me agredable quanto c&#363; V. S. parla,
almeno per scriptura di propria mano, non potendo la per hora
partialmente goder. In bona gratia sua senza fine riccoman<sup>mi</sup>
cum ricordo del presto e sano ritorno, cosi N. S. Dio degni di
conservarlo longamente. Mlo. li 7. Zugno. 1535.</p>

<p>. . .La sant&eacute; de votre petit fils est aussi bonne que lui fut
onques. Il mange fort bien, et l'on le m&egrave;ne souvent a les
&eacute;bats que me semble lui fait grant bien. Il me semble vous
trouverez cru et devenu gras. Quant au reste de n're m&eacute;nage,
v're s&#339;ur est toujours malade de sa fi&egrave;vre et a &eacute;t&eacute; cette semaine
pass&eacute;e bien mal d'un flux de ventre qui l'a fort affoiblie. Il
y a bien huit jours qu'elle ne bouge point du lit. Depuis
hier le flux com&#772;&agrave;se a passer, de la fi&egrave;vre je ne vois pas grant
amendement. . . . V<sup>re</sup> fr&egrave;re Claude a &eacute;t&eacute; aussy malade
jusqu'&agrave; la mort. . . . V<sup>re</sup> s&#339;ur Anthoinette est aussy malade
d'une fi&egrave;vre et d'un rhume. . . . Je vous avise quo Madame
v<sup>re</sup> tante est mand&eacute;e pour aller &agrave; la cour &agrave; la venue de la
Reyne de Hongrie, qui doit bientost estre &agrave; Compi&egrave;gne, ou le
Roy et toute la Court doit estre en peu de jours. Je m'en
suis excus&eacute;e pour l'amour de mes malades. Il n'y a que deux
jours que le gentilhomme du Roy d'Angleterre qui f&ucirc;t au
Havre et le paintre, a &eacute;t&eacute; ici. Le gentilhomme vint vers moi,
faisant semblant venir de trouver l'Empereur, et que ayant su
Louise malade, il n'avait voullu passer sans la voir, afin d'en
savoir dire de nouvelles au Roy son maistre, me priant qu'il
la peut voir, ce qu'il fit, et c'estait le jour de sa fi&egrave;vre. Il lui
tint pareil propos qu'a moi, puis me dit qu'estant si pr&egrave;s
de Lorrayne, il avait envye d'aller jusques &agrave; Nancy, voir le
pays. Je ne me donte incontyment il y allait voir la demoyselle
peur la tirer comme les aultres et pour cela j'ai envoy&eacute;
&agrave; leur logis, voir qui y &eacute;tait, et j'ai trouv&eacute; le dit paintre y<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
&eacute;tait, et de la ils ont est&eacute; &agrave; Nancy et y ont rest&eacute; un jour, et ont
&eacute;t&eacute; fort fest&eacute;s, et le Maistre d'h&ocirc;tel venait &agrave; tous les repas
manger avec eux, avec force pr&eacute;sents, et ils etaient tr&egrave;s bien
trait&eacute;s. Voil&agrave; ce que j'ay entendu, donc au pis aller, si vous
n'avez pour voisine v<sup>re</sup> s&#339;ur, ce pourrait estre v<sup>re</sup> cousine.
Il se tient quelque propos que l'Empereur offre r&eacute;compense
pour le duch&eacute; de Gueldres, et que ce faisant, se pourrait faire
quelque mariage de la fille de Hongrie et de Mons<sup>r</sup> le Marquys.
Mons<sup>r</sup> v<sup>re</sup> p&egrave;re entend bien, ce faisant, avoir sa part en la dite
r&eacute;compense. Je voudrais qu'il en fust bien r&eacute;compens&eacute;.
Voil&agrave; tout ce que j'ay de nouveau . . . je me doute que vous
ne ferez de si bonne diligence que moi, car je sais bien que
vous tenez de Mons<sup>r</sup> v'tre p&egrave;re, et qu'estes paresseuse &agrave; ecrire,
si l'air d'Ecosse ne vous a chang&eacute;. Je n'ai encore eu que
vos premy&egrave;res. Il me tarde bien savoir comme depuis vous
vous serez port&eacute;, cela me sera grant joye quand je pourrait
ouir de vos nouvelles. Ce sera toujours quant N<sup>tre</sup> Seigneur
le veuille, et je prie, Madame, qu'il vous donne longue et bonne
vie. Ce premier de Septembre, de v'tre humble et bonne
m&egrave;re,</p>

<p>Madame: J'ay tard&eacute; plus longuement que je ne pensais &agrave;
vous escrire, mais les noces de Mademoiselle de Lorraine nous
ont tant ameus&eacute;es que jusque &agrave; cette heure on a peut avoir
le loisir. Nous departismes hier de la compaignye qui a est&eacute;
bien grosse. Les noces furent Mardy pass&eacute;. Mons<sup>r</sup> le Prince
y est venu bien accompaign&eacute; et je vous assure c'est un bien
honeste Prince et de bonne gr&acirc;ce. Il se contente fort de sa
mye, et aussi elle de lui. Ils s'entendent aller chez eux dans
xv. jours. La feste a est&eacute; &agrave; Bar, il n'y a eu gu&egrave;res d'estrangers,
fors la Marquise de Baulde et Madame de Ba&ccedil;in, et des Comtesses
et dames voisines. Vous en saurez quelque jour plus
au long. Nous sommes en chemin pour aller &agrave; Guise, pensant
en estre de retour pour la Toussaint. Nous laissons n'tre petit
fils &agrave; Roche. Il court tant de maladie que nous n'avons os&eacute;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
le mettre en chemin, mais je vous assure il se porte bien. . . .
Je vous avais escrit par Saint-Genould, du mariage de v're
fr&egrave;re, mais j'entens qu'il ne part pas si tost comme il m'avait
dit, pourquoi je veulx vous dire ce qui en est et co<sup>me</sup> le Roy
veult faire le mariage de luy et de la ny&egrave;ce du Pape, fille du
Duc de &mdash;&mdash; je ne puis retrouver son nom, mais elle est belle
et honeste et a bonne gr&acirc;ce, et est d'ancienne maison, de
l'age de xv. ans. L'on luy donne trois cent mille francs en
mariage, elle n'a que ung fr&egrave;re, s'il meurt elle serait heriti&egrave;re de
quarante mille livres et d'un Duch&eacute; et aultre terres. Je pense
entre ceci et la Toussaint il en sera fait ou failli. Je prends
grand plaisir entendre par vos lettres le bon portement du Roy,
de vous et du petit prince. . . . Nous sommes pr&ecirc;ts &agrave;
monter &agrave; cheval, pourquoi ferais fin. . . . Ce penulti&egrave;me

<i>Antoinette de Bourbon, Duchesse de Guise, to Mary, Queen of

<p>Madame: L'on m'a tant assur&eacute; qu'on envoye les lettres
s&ucirc;rement par le moyen des Marchands d'Anvers, que je les
ai mis &agrave; l'entr&eacute;e pour en apprendre le chemin. Vostre s&#339;ur
en doit estre la messag&egrave;re. Je vous ai escrit la conclusion de
son mariage et envoy&eacute; les articles et depuis ses noces par
vostre brodeur. Je viens de la mener en m&eacute;nage, en une
belle et honneste maison et aultant bien meubl&eacute;e qu'il est
possible, nomm&eacute; Beaumoult. Son beau-p&egrave;re la receuillit tant
honorablement et avec tant de gens de bien et grosse compaignye
que l'on ne sait plus souhaiter; la Reyne de Hongrerie
entre les aultres s'y trouvait et la Duchesse de Myllan, aussi
Mons<sup>r</sup> et Madame la Princesse d'Orange, qui l'on tient grosse,
toute fois la chose n'est pas fort sure, et pour ma part j'en
doute. Il me semble v're dite s&#339;ur est bien log&eacute;e. L'on luy
a fait de beau pr&eacute;sens, et elle a de belles basques. Son Mary
est jeune, mais il a bon vouloir d'estre du nombre des gens de
bien. Il ne paraissait point qu'il f&ucirc;t Caresme, car les armes et
les tambours ne cessaient point; il s'y est fait de beaux joustes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
l&agrave; bas. A la fin il a fallu departir, qui n'a pas est&eacute; sans
larmes. Je regagne ce lieu de Guyse, o&ugrave; je ne reste qu'une
nuit, et demain &agrave; la F&egrave;re, o&ugrave; Mons<sup>r</sup> le Cardinal mon fr&egrave;re et
mon p&egrave;re et ma s&#339;ur de S<sup>t</sup> Pol seront mercredy, et vendredy
recommencerai me mettre en chemin pour gagner Joinvylle
le plus tost que je pourrais. Je pense trouver encore Mons<sup>r</sup>
v<sup>re</sup> p&egrave;re, et nos enfans, savoir les petits et les pr&egrave;tres. . . .

<i>Louise de Lorraine, Princesse de Chimay, to Mary, Queen of
Scotland.</i></h3>

<p>Madame: Depuys que Dieu a tant faict pour moi que de me
donner un bon Mary, je n'ai point eu loisir de vous en faire la
part. Vous pouvez estre assur&eacute;e que je me tiens en ce monde
heureuse d'estre en la maison ou je suis, car avec la grandeur
qu'il y a en tout, j'ai un seigneur et beau-p&egrave;re que je vous puis
nommer bon, car il me faict un bien bon traitement, accompagn&eacute;
de tant de beaux pr&eacute;sents, qu'il me faudroy employer
trois feuilles de papier avant que je vous pourrais en rendre
bon conte et qui sera, s'il vous plait, occasion de prendre
contentement du bien de votre s&#339;ur, qui a commandement de
vous offrir les tr&egrave;s humble services des maistres et seigneurs
de cette maison, vous suppliant a tout endroit les employer.
Nous avons une tr&egrave;s sage et vertueuse Reyne, et je ne puis
vous dire l'honneur qu'elle me faict, car estant venue expr&eacute;s
&agrave; cette maison&mdash;la sienne et n&ocirc;tre&mdash;elle m'a voulu prendre
pour sa tr&egrave;s humble fille et servante, et veulst que pour
l'avenyr je dois estre toujours en sa compagnye, o&ugrave; pour le
peu que j'y ai este m'a fayct fort grant ch&#277;re. Madame la
Duchesse de Mylan m'a dit le semblable, qui est la meilleure,
et nous &eacute;sperons bient&ocirc;t la voir en Lorayne, car le maryage
de Mons<sup>r</sup> le Marquys et d'elle, est en tr&egrave;s bon train. Depuis
que Madame ma m&egrave;re est retourn&egrave;e, elle m'a envoy&eacute;e une
lettre pour essayer si le chemin de &ccedil;a luy sera plus aise que
l'autre, et si'il vous plait de m'apprendre de vos nouvelles, je
serai merveilleusement aise. Mais il faudra, Madame que a
la lettre que vous m'enverrez, vous mettiez sur le paquet,
"<i>Au Duc d'Aerschot</i>," et par les marchands qui viennent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
d'Ecosse, il vous sera ais&eacute;, car en les laissant &agrave; Anvers ou &agrave;
Bruges, ou autre endroit du Pays, ne failleront point, en
s'adressant a Mons<sup>r</sup> mon beau-p&egrave;re, de tomber entre mes
mains, car il est grandement craint et aim&eacute; par de&ccedil;a, qui sera
l'endroit o&ugrave; je supplye Dieu qu'il vous donne tr&egrave;s bonne vie
et longue. De Beaumont, ce xxv. jour de Mars.</p>

<p>Madame: Je suis tr&egrave;s aise que ce porteur soit venu par ici,
pour s'en retourner vers vous, car je vous voullais escrire et
envoyer un paquet. . . . Je desire bien fort savoir comme
vous vous serez port&eacute; en v're couche et aussi comme le Roy et
v're petit prince se portent. Je prie a N. S. &agrave; tous donner
bonne sant&eacute; et longue vie. Quant &agrave; notre cost&eacute;, tout se porte
bien, Dieu mercy! Mon<sup>r</sup> v're p&egrave;re est revenu depuis huit
jours pour quelques bastyments et fortifications que le Roy
lui a ordonn&eacute; faire en cette fronti&egrave;re. J'ay est&eacute; tr&egrave;s aise il
ait cette charge, afin de l'avoir plus tost de retour. Quant
&agrave; v're petit fils, il se porte bien et devient grand; il commence
tr&egrave;s bien apprendre, et sait quasi son Pater noster, il est joli et
bon enfant. J'ai est&eacute; cause qu'il n'est venu en ce lien, dans
la pour des Rougeolles, qui r&eacute;gnent si fort, et je crains il les
prends par les champs, ou il ne peut estre si bien traist&eacute; qu'&agrave;
Joinvylle, et aussi que ne devons demeurer dans ce lieu que
huit jours. . . . Nous attendons M. le Cardinal de Lorraine
le iii. d'Ao&ucirc;t. Il vient pour nous tous ensemble trouver au
Pont-&agrave;-Mousson le huiti&egrave;me du dit mois, on se doit faire le
premyer recueil de n'tre nouvelle Dame, pour la mener &agrave; Nancy.
V're fr&egrave;re aussi vient avec M. le Cardinal, l'on doit faire grande
chere a cette bien venue, et force tournois. Les noces furent
il y a Dimanche huit jours. S'il s'y fait rien digne de vous
faire part vous en serez avertie. J'ai bonne envye de voir si
Mons<sup>r</sup> le Marquis sera bon Mary! L'on se jouit fort au pays
recevoir une si honneste Princesse . . . ce xx. Juillet de . . . ec.</p>

<p>Madame: Je ne saurais vous escrire la grande d&eacute;solation en
laquelle est present&eacute;ment Madame ma s&#339;ur, constitu&eacute; par la
grande rudesse et cruaut&eacute; que le jour du grand Vendredy luy

avecque tous les honneurs possible, et le meilleur traistement,
et le dit jour du grand Vendredy il fit entendre &agrave; Madame
comme pour satisfaire au capitulations de la Ligue, il falloit
qu'il s'assurait de Monseigneur le duc de Lorraine, et de ses
places, et que pour ce faire il falloit qu'il fust transport&eacute; &agrave;

laisse Mesdames ses filles et l'administration des biens, comme
elle avait auparavant, reserv&eacute; les places fortes, qui demeurent
&agrave; la charge de Monseigneur de Vaudemont, &agrave; condition que
Votre Majest&eacute; pourra voire, toutefois n'y demeurra que

plaira me commander ce que je fasse, et vous serez ob&eacute;y
comme la plus affection&eacute;e servante que Votre Majest&eacute; aura

<p>Magnifico Signore, Innocenzio: Ho ricevuto un altra vostra,
inteso la morte del Magnifico Signor Belloni, che certo mi ha
dato molto fastidio. Io sono certa che la Signora mia madre
me haver&agrave; havuto grandissimo dispiacere, come risentir&agrave; la
morte e privatione di tale amico. Per&ograve; non si pu&ograve; resistere
al Divino volere. Mi maraviglia molto non habbiati avuto
la littera mia qual mandai alli di passati, in mane di Barile,
per&ograve; di novo vi dico che ho ricevuto la corona ed altre cose
per Andronica, et le littere della Signore Madre, et cos&igrave; vi
rimand&ograve; la risposta. Sareti contenti basare le mane in mio
nome a Sua Excellentia, dicendoli che mi duole fino all' anima,
dalle travaglie che patisse Sua Excellentia in quelle bande, et
che siamo sempre apparentiati come servitori che li giurano
esponere la vita et quanto tenemo in suo serviggio. Non mi
occorrente altro a Vostra Signoria mi raccomando. De
Codogno all. 29. Sett, 1552. Di Vostra Sig. Dejanira,
Contessa Trivultia.</p>
